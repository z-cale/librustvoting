# Nullifier Service Setup

The nullifier service ingests Orchard nullifiers from the Zcash chain and serves exclusion proofs to voters. It must be running before any votes can be constructed — the voting UI and e2e tests query it to generate non-inclusion proofs that prevent double-voting.

## What it does

- **`ingest-nfs`** — incrementally fetches 32-byte Orchard nullifiers from a lightwallet server (`zec.rocks` by default) into flat binary files (`nullifiers.bin`, `nullifiers.checkpoint`, `nullifiers.tree`).
- **`query-server`** — reads those files and exposes an HTTP API (default port `3000`) that returns Merkle non-inclusion proofs for a given nullifier.

Both binaries are built from `nullifier-ingest/service/` (Rust, release mode).

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS (amd64 or arm64)
- Internet access to download the nullifier snapshot and sync from the lightwallet server
- `./nullifier.sh run` installs all other dependencies automatically

## Quick start

From the repo root, run the fully automated setup:

```bash
./nullifier.sh run
```

This performs three steps in sequence:

1. **Install dependencies** — installs system packages (`build-essential`, `wget`, `pkg-config`, `libssl-dev`) and Rust/cargo via `rustup` if not already present.
2. **Bootstrap** — downloads a pre-built nullifier snapshot (`nullifiers.bin`, `nullifiers.checkpoint`, `nullifiers.tree`) from the Zally bootstrap server so you don't have to sync from block 0.
3. **Serve** — compiles `query-server` in release mode and starts it. The first build takes a few minutes; subsequent starts are fast.

The server runs in the foreground. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

To run in the background and log output to a file:

```bash
nohup ./nullifier.sh serve > nullifier-serve.log 2>&1 &
echo "PID: $!"
```

## Step-by-step

If you prefer to run each phase separately:

### Step 1 — Install dependencies

```bash
./nullifier.sh install-deps
```

Installs:
- Linux: `build-essential`, `wget`, `pkg-config`, `libssl-dev`, `curl` via `apt-get`
- macOS: `wget` via Homebrew (if not already present)
- Rust stable toolchain via `rustup` (skipped if `cargo` is already in `PATH`)

### Step 2 — Bootstrap nullifier snapshot

```bash
./nullifier.sh bootstrap
```

Downloads the pre-built snapshot files into `nullifier-ingest/` if they are not already present:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `nullifiers.bin` | Append-only flat file of 32-byte nullifier blobs |
| `nullifiers.checkpoint` | 16-byte crash-recovery marker (last synced height + file offset) |
| `nullifiers.tree` | Cached full Merkle tree sidecar |

If the checkpoint file already exists the download is skipped (idempotent).

### Step 3 — Start the query server

```bash
./nullifier.sh serve
```

Compiles and starts `query-server`. On the first run Cargo downloads and compiles all dependencies — this typically takes 3–5 minutes. Subsequent starts compile only changed code.

Once running, the server listens on `http://localhost:3000` and accepts exclusion proof requests from the voting UI and e2e tests.

## Check status

```bash
./nullifier.sh status
```

Prints:
- Number of ingested nullifiers and file size
- Last synced block height from the checkpoint
- Tree sidecar presence and size
- Whether `query-server` is currently running

## Ingesting new nullifiers

After the initial bootstrap the snapshot may be behind the chain tip. To sync new nullifiers incrementally (safe to run while the server is stopped):

```bash
make ingest
```

Or with a specific upper bound (must be a multiple of 10):

```bash
make ingest SYNC_HEIGHT=2600000
```

After ingesting, restart the server so it picks up the new data:

```bash
./nullifier.sh serve
```

## Environment overrides

All defaults can be overridden via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LWD_URL` | `https://zec.rocks:443` | Lightwallet server to fetch nullifiers from |
| `DATA_DIR` | `nullifier-ingest` | Directory for `nullifiers.bin` / `.checkpoint` / `.tree` |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port for the exclusion proof query server |
| `BOOTSTRAP_URL` | `https://vote.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com` | Base URL for snapshot file downloads |

Example — use a custom lightwallet server and data directory:

```bash
LWD_URL=https://my-node:443 DATA_DIR=/data/nullifiers ./nullifier.sh run
```

## Useful commands

```bash
# Check how many nullifiers have been ingested
./nullifier.sh status

# Run unit tests for the nullifier-tree and service crates
make ingest-test

# Verify exclusion proofs against the ingested data
make ingest-proof

# Stop the query server
pkill query-server

# Remove all build artifacts and data files (destructive)
make ingest-clean
```
