# Helper submission invariants

## Status and scope

This document records the helper-share submission invariants implemented by
`zcash_voting`. It is an audit map for wallet integrators and reviewers. It
covers planning, initial delivery, transport outcomes, persistence,
confirmation polling, and recovery.

The implementation is authoritative. A change to an invariant below SHOULD
update this document and the named regression tests in the same pull request.
Values exposed as policy metadata but not enforced by a particular API are
called out explicitly.

The main implementation surfaces are:

- [`share_policy`](../zcash_voting/src/share_policy/), whose
  [`mod.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_policy/mod.rs) facade exposes helper
  placement, server ordering, submission scheduling, and timing implemented in
  [`initial_placement.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_policy/initial_placement.rs),
  [`server_order.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_policy/server_order.rs),
  [`submission_schedule.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_policy/submission_schedule.rs),
  and [`timing.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_policy/timing.rs);
- [`helper`](../zcash_voting/src/helper/), which defines helper identity,
  transport, retry, and health behavior;
- [`share_tracking`](../zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/), whose
  [`mod.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/mod.rs) facade coordinates the
  validated fleet, durable complete-plan lifecycle, initial fan-out, polling,
  and recovery implemented in
  [`configured_fleet.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/configured_fleet.rs),
  [`delivery_plan.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/delivery_plan.rs),
  [`initial_delivery.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/initial_delivery.rs),
  [`confirmation.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/confirmation.rs), and
  [`recovery.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/recovery.rs);
- [`share`](../zcash_voting/src/share.rs), which derives and records share
  identity and reconstructs recovery payloads; and
- [`storage`](../zcash_voting/src/storage/), whose
  [`queries/mod.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/storage/queries/mod.rs) facade and
  [`queries/share_delegations.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/storage/queries/share_delegations.rs)
  preserve delivery state across restarts.

## Confidentiality statement

The primary confidentiality adversary considered by the helper-distribution
policy is collusion by the MPC validator committee. Decrypting an encrypted
share requires control of at least the protocol's two-thirds validator
threshold. For a complete normal commitment planned once as one batch with at
least two configured helpers, an adversary controlling that threshold together
with one helper can obtain at most 12 of the 16 plaintext shares from that
helper's returned initial target assignments.

This is a 75-percent share-count bound, not necessarily a bound on the
percentage of voting balance revealed. It is an initial-planning statement,
not a lifetime possession bound: ambiguous delivery, initial-delivery
fallback, replenishment, overdue recovery, fleet changes, legacy delivery
state that predates complete-plan persistence, and single-share mode fall
outside it. New SDK planning atomically persists the complete commitment-wide
plan before any POST and reuses it across restart; it never replans only the
missing subset. New plans without preexisting delivery rows report
`SharePlacementGuarantee::Strict`.
`SharePlacementGuarantee::LegacyBestEffort` (abbreviated `LegacyBestEffort`
below) records that delivery rows already existed without a complete original
plan. It is metadata about old state, not permission to discard or recompute a
plan. The statement also makes no claim about the combined view of colluding
helpers.

## Terminology and state model

A **configured helper** is a canonical HTTP or HTTPS helper endpoint in the
wallet's current configuration. This is a routing and persistence identity,
not an authenticated operator identity: distinct canonical URLs are counted as
distinct helpers even when they are controlled by one operator, terminate at
one backend, or change operators over time.

A **definite acceptance** is a `POST /shares` response with status `queued` or
`duplicate`. Its helper is stored in `sent_to_urls`.

An **ambiguous attempt** is a POST that may have reached the helper but did not
produce a usable acceptance response. Its helper is stored in
`ambiguous_urls`. Ambiguous attempts are poll-only and do not count as definite
placements.

An **attempting helper** is an initial-submission or recovery target durably
reserved in `attempting_urls` before its POST is dispatched. A process
interruption can leave that reservation without a classified response; on
restart it is treated as outcome-unknown and receives one duplicate-safe
reconciliation attempt per pass after untried helpers. Cancellation that is
observed before a fresh reservation dispatches is different: because the POST
is definitely unsent, the reservation is cleared as a definite failure rather
than retained as outcome-unknown.

"Durably reserved before its POST is dispatched" is a claim about the shipped
binary, not about a test run. The reservation's only state mutation must sit on
the ordinary execution path, never inside an assertion the compiler removes: a
`debug_assert!` erases its argument in release, so a marker written there is
recorded in every test and in no released build. The failure is invisible to
the whole suite, and its symptom is precisely the one this section exists to
prevent — a crash mid-POST leaving no evidence the helper was ever contacted,
so recovery treats a possibly-delivered share as untried.
`no_debug_assert_hides_a_fallible_call` guards the obvious form of this.

An **interrupted helper** is an attempting helper whose durable reservation is
loaded by a later tracking operation with no corresponding live request in
that operation. The earlier process may have stopped before dispatch, during
transport, or before persisting the response, so interruption proves neither
acceptance nor non-acceptance. It remains in `attempting_urls` until a
duplicate-safe reconciliation classifies it as accepted or explicitly
ambiguous.

Initial network fan-out and tracking acquire one process-wide asynchronous lock
keyed by wallet, round, bundle, proposal, and share. Durable initial preparation
occurs before that lock and is protected by its own generation-bound atomic
write. After acquiring the lock, each network operation re-reads the exact
nullifier generation. Two live operations in one process therefore cannot
mistake each other's reservation for an interrupted attempt, act on a replaced
generation, or independently advance through fallback helpers. The durable
initial-reservation compare-and-swap also counts configured accepted and
attempting helpers against the placement target, so separate database
connections cannot reserve disjoint excess initial placements. This lock is
per share; unrelated shares remain independent.

The durable **placement target** is the desired number of definite helper
acceptances for one share. Tracking caps its effective value to both the
protocol's helper target cap and the size of the current valid configured
fleet. A share is **under-placed** while the number of currently configured
helpers in `sent_to_urls` is below that effective target.

A share is **confirmed** when its reveal nullifier is considered confirmed on
the vote chain. Confirmation is global; it is not proof that the particular
helper answering the status request possesses the share.

**Early replenishment** repairs under-placement before the share is overdue and
preserves its original `submit_at`. **Overdue recovery** occurs after the
timing threshold and rebuilds the payload with `submit_at = 0`.

The durable state transition is:

```text
initial target --> attempting_urls --> initial POST
                                      |-- definite --> sent_to_urls
                                      \-- unknown --> ambiguous_urls

under-placed or overdue --> attempting_urls --> recovery POST
                                               |-- definite --> sent_to_urls
                                               \-- unknown --> ambiguous_urls

early or overdue: attempting_urls --> duplicate-safe re-POST
                                      |-- accepted --> sent_to_urls
                                      \-- otherwise --> ambiguous_urls

overdue only: ambiguous_urls --> duplicate-safe re-POST
                                |-- accepted --> sent_to_urls
                                \-- otherwise --> unchanged

sent_to_urls, ambiguous_urls, or attempting_urls
    -- confirmed status from the configured quorum --> confirmed
```

The authoritative in-memory contract is `ShareDeliveryState` in
[`share.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share.rs). Its precedence is **Accepted >
OutcomeUnknown > InFlight**: stronger evidence replaces weaker evidence, while
weaker evidence cannot replace stronger evidence. The persisted public/schema
field names remain `sent_to_urls`, `ambiguous_urls`, and `attempting_urls`,
respectively, and MUST remain disjoint. The same state transitions are enforced
for storage updates in
[`storage/queries/share_delegations.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/storage/queries/share_delegations.rs).
`delivery_state_preserves_order_and_strongest_evidence` exercises this
precedence directly.

An explicitly ambiguous helper is poll-only for early replenishment. An
interrupted helper is retried after every untried helper, even without vote-end
timing, and at most once per tracking pass. Helper-side duplicate detection
(`duplicate` is a definite acceptance) makes the re-POST converge instead of
double-counting. Acceptance moves it to `sent_to_urls`; any completed
non-acceptance moves the crash marker to explicit `ambiguous_urls`, preventing
unbounded early replay while preserving the original unknown outcome.

## Planning invariants

### Initial-distribution policy

Planning combines an explicit protocol fan-out cap with a per-helper limit
derived from the canonical normal-commitment share count. Let:

```text
S = VOTE_COMMITMENT_SHARE_COUNT
C = SHARE_HELPER_TARGET_COUNT_CAP = 10
N = number of distinct configured helpers
R = number of ready helpers in the readiness-ranked prefix
```

The normal protocol MUST have `S >= 2`. Single-share mode is a separate mode,
is valid only when the planned payload count is exactly one, does not change
`S`, and is exempt from the commitment-wide distribution bound below. A caller
cannot mark an `S`-share commitment as single-share to bypass that bound.
`C = 10` is an independent protocol choice: it bounds initial
fan-out and prevents fleet growth from increasing per-share distribution
without limit. It is not derived from `S`.

The strict initial per-helper share fraction is three quarters. Its integer
limit rounds down so it never exceeds 75 percent:

```text
max_initial_shares_per_helper = M = floor(3S / 4)
```

The per-share definite-placement target remains half the configured fleet,
rounded up, until it reaches the protocol cap:

```text
target_count = T = min(ceil(N / 2), C)
```

For the current `S = 16` and `C = 10`, these formulas produce `M = 12`.
Consequently, fleets through 20 helpers retain the half-rounded-up target,
while larger fleets target at most 10 definite acceptances per share.

For a complete normal commitment, planning creates `S * T` assignments. The
planning pool MUST contain enough helpers for every assignment without any
helper exceeding `M`:

```text
minimum_planning_pool = P_min = ceil(S * T / M)
planning_pool = P = min(N, max(R, P_min))
```

The one-helper fleet is the only forced-full-coverage exception: it uses
`T = P = 1`, and that helper necessarily receives every initially planned
share. For every `N >= 2`, the derived capacity MUST fit within the configured
fleet before planning succeeds. A future change to `S` or the three-quarters
ratio that makes the capacity infeasible MUST fail planning explicitly rather
than silently weakening the target or the per-helper bound.

The current values include:

| Configured helpers `N` | Target `T` | Minimum pool `P_min` | Effective initial maximum |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 (forced exception) | 16 |
| 2 | 1 | 2 | 12 |
| 3 | 2 | 3 | 12 |
| 5 | 3 | 4 | 12 |
| 10 | 5 | 7 | 12 |
| 20 | 10 | 14 | 12 |
| 30 | 10 | 14 | 12 |
| 100 | 10 | 14 | 12 |

The selector MUST enforce `M` as a hard quota while constructing a complete
batch, not merely rely on an average produced by balancing. Among helpers
below the quota, it continues to prefer the lowest current assignment count
and uses independent CSPRNG-derived order to break ties. If it cannot select
`T` distinct helpers for a share without exceeding the quota, planning fails.

Readiness selects the planning-pool prefix but does not weaken its required
capacity. If `R < P_min`, the pool includes the first `P_min - R` configured
fallback helpers after the ready prefix. This is an explicit tradeoff: the
strict initial distribution bound may require planning across helpers that did
not answer readiness probing.

The derived bound applies only to the returned target lists for one complete
normal batch of exactly `S` shares. It does not claim that a helper can never
physically hold more than `M` shares:

- single-share mode necessarily gives a selected helper the only share;
- incomplete low-level batches, independently planned shares, and legacy rows
  that predate complete-plan persistence have no commitment-wide usage history and
  therefore provide no percentage bound;
- an ambiguous POST may have reached a helper without producing a definite
  acceptance; and
- initial fallback, early replenishment, overdue recovery, and fleet changes
  remain liveness-first and may give a helper an initially omitted share.

An absolute lifetime possession cap is intentionally not claimed. Enforcing
one would make ambiguous delivery unknowable and could prevent recovery from
using the only functioning helper.

The assignment limit `M` is a wallet-policy consequence of `S`, and `P_min` is
calculated from `S`, `T`, and `M`; neither makes `S` independently
configurable. `C` is separately chosen protocol policy. Changing `S` remains a
coordinated protocol change across the circuits, wallet wire validation,
helper payload validation, chain types, and their fixed-size arrays and tests.
Changing `C` changes helper distribution and recovery redundancy but does not
change the share format.

Existing durable rows whose stored `target_count` exceeds `C` keep their
historical value but MUST use `C` as their effective target. This read-time
clamp avoids a schema migration while preventing a legacy value from restoring
the old uncapped behavior.

Regression coverage:

- target count remains half-rounded-up through `N = 20` and is capped by the
  independent protocol constant `C = 10` above that boundary;
- the maximum initial assignment count is derived as `floor(3S / 4)`;
- the minimum pool is derived as `ceil(S * T / M)` at small, boundary, and
  large fleet sizes;
- every helper in a complete normal batch is assigned at most `M` shares;
- planning fails rather than exceeding `M` when presented with an infeasible
  capacity;
- the one-helper and single-share forced-coverage exceptions are explicit;
- single-share mode rejects zero, incomplete, and complete multi-share batches;
- incomplete or independently planned low-level batches and legacy pre-v17
  state do not advertise the complete batch guarantee;
- fallback and recovery remain able to exceed the initial-only quota; and
- `legacy_target_above_protocol_cap_is_effectively_clamped` ensures a durable
  target above the protocol cap cannot drive new placements above the
  canonical target.

### Share count and identity

1. A normal vote commitment contains 16 encrypted shares. Single-share mode
   emits only domain share index 0, and the planner rejects `single_share =
   true` unless the committed vote contains exactly one payload. The SDK
   derives this mode from the committed payload count; the host cannot pass a
   contradictory mode flag.
2. Share indexes identify the post-ZKP-2 shuffled shares. Share index 0 does
   not imply a particular denomination or value.
3. At most one share is designated as the round's immediate share. It is share
   index 0 of the lowest voted proposal ID in the highest eligible bundle
   index. Bundles are value-descending, so this is the lowest-value eligible
   bundle.
4. The immediate designation is derived from durable ballot choices the
   first time the designated vote's own plan is prepared, and is then durable
   state of its own (`round_immediate_share`, schema version 20): stable
   across restart and vote completion, written once in the plan's
   transaction, never updated, voided only with the undispatched generation
   it was made for. Skipped proposals do not participate. Every later plan
   reads the row and never re-derives it, so a designated proposal that
   leaves the authenticated roster after its vote reached the chain lifecycle
   keeps the designation and planning for the remaining roster names no
   second share (`derive_immediate_share`, regression tests
   `a_persisted_immediate_designation_survives_its_proposal_leaving_the_roster`,
   `the_designated_votes_own_plan_writes_the_designation_and_every_plan_reads_it`,
   `the_designation_is_voided_with_its_undispatched_generation_but_not_by_confirmation`,
   `a_later_lower_choice_does_not_move_the_designation_or_block_its_submission`).
5. `immediate = true` and `submit_at = 0` are not equivalent. Last-moment and
   single-share planning can assign `submit_at = 0` to undesignated shares,
   but the designated immediate share MUST always have `submit_at = 0`.
6. **Initial delivery dispatches the designated share before the round's other
   shares, and concurrent deliveries of the same round wait for it to reach a
   helper.** The designation names the *highest* eligible bundle, which is the
   last to reach the chain, while initial delivery runs once per confirmed unit
   — so without this the share a voter waits on is submitted after the bundles
   that confirmed earlier. Measured against staging on a 37-proposal round, 67%
   of the round's shares preceded it with bundles running serially and 8% with
   them concurrent.

   The guarantee is best-effort and bounded on both sides. A call holding the
   designation dispatches it first. A call without it proceeds on **any** of
   three conditions, and never waits past the last of them:

   1. the designated share already has a definite acceptance recorded against it
      — an acknowledged enqueue, not a chain confirmation, and a duplicate answer
      counts;
   2. the call holding the designated share finished with it, **including with a
      refusal or any other non-acceptance outcome** — a share no helper took will
      not arrive by being waited for, so the round is released rather than made to
      spend its budget discovering that; or
   3. the wait budget expired, so a round whose designated bundle has not
      confirmed never stalls the bundles that are ready.

   Condition 2 covers a designated share this call cannot dispatch at all — one
   whose preparation failed — as well as one the helpers refused. Holder identity
   is resolved from the durable designation against the call's votes rather than
   from its job list, because a failed preparation contributes no job and would
   otherwise read as another call's responsibility, leaving this call's own
   siblings waiting for a share already in front of them.

   A wait is recorded as `helper::immediate_gate_wait`, with `Pending` marking
   one that expired. Every share's `helper::delivery_queue_wait` is already open
   when the gate wait begins, so without its own record an expired wait would be
   charged to generic queue time and read as delivery contention.

   Cancellation while waiting leaves the shares pending, as any cancelled
   admission does.

   Conditions 1 and 2 both persist for the round within a process: a release is
   remembered, so a later pass does not wait again for a designated share that
   has already been dealt with. That matters most for a refusal, which records no
   acceptance and would otherwise send every later pass into the full budget
   waiting for a share no helper took. The memory is bounded and does not survive
   a restart, after which condition 1 still covers an accepted share and a refused
   one pays a single wait once.

   Condition 1 is read from durable state once, beside the plan loads the call
   has already performed, which is what lets a later pass or anything after a
   restart proceed with no state carried between calls. The wait budget bounds
   the **wait**; it does not bound that read, and could not — a blocking
   connection acquisition is not preemptible by a timer, and this path performs
   one such read per proposal before the gate is reached at all. It is not re-read while waiting: a durable read takes the
   sidecar connection that delivery is using continuously, and re-reading it on
   every tick could block a bounded wait past its own deadline. Nothing is lost,
   because a share accepted while this call waits is being accepted by a sibling
   call in the same process, which is condition 2.

   Within one share's fan-out the boundary is the completion of its wave: the
   executor resolves a wave's outcomes only after all of its POSTs return,
   deliberately and serially, so that a stale generation aborts before a later
   write can mask it. That ordering is not changed here; the difference it costs
   is at most one wave's slowest reply, is bounded by the wait budget regardless,
   and is zero for a single-target placement.

   It deliberately stops at ordering *inside* one call: holding a call's own
   shares behind its designated one would break the no-proposal-barrier property
   (`combined_reconciliation_delivers_later_proposals_while_the_first_is_unfinished`)
   and prevent a full commitment reaching the POST ceiling
   (`full_commitment_reaches_but_never_exceeds_128_posts`). Both are deliberate,
   and every share measured ahead of the designated one belonged to another
   bundle, which is what the gate addresses.

### Placement target

For `N` distinct configured helpers and protocol target cap `C = 10`, every
initial share target is:

```text
target_count = min(ceil(N / 2), C)
```

The concrete values include:

| Configured helpers | Target |
| ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 |
| 5 | 3 |
| 10 | 5 |
| 20 | 10 |
| 21 | 10 |
| 30 | 10 |
| 100 | 10 |

An empty helper list is invalid even though the pure target-count function
returns zero. The high-level entry point does not accept an unvalidated raw
list: `HelperClient::preflight_fleet` canonicalizes the complete fleet, rejects
empty or duplicate canonical identities, derives the readiness target
internally, and returns `HelperFleetPreflight`.
FFI boundaries may reconstruct the same public snapshot with
`HelperFleetPreflight::from_readiness`; it applies the same nonempty,
canonical, and distinct configured-fleet checks and additionally requires the
ready list to be a distinct subset of that fleet.
`CommittedVote::prepare_share_delivery` consumes that validated snapshot.
It also consumes the complete proposal-id roster from the authenticated round
configuration. The roster must be nonempty, distinct, and exactly match the
round's durable terminal decisions. Those decisions are the recorded ballot
intents plus, for a vote the chain lifecycle owns or has finished that has no
intent of its own, its stored choice: such a vote is the wallet's transaction
whatever the ballot says, its shares are owed, and its choice stands
(`durable_decisions`, regression test
`a_lifecycle_owned_vote_without_an_intent_still_plans_and_delivers_its_shares`).
The SDK combines those decisions with the durable bundle set to seed the
single immediate share the first time; the host does not select an immediate
share index.

The planner carries the other half of that contract: `resume_plan` does not
emit `NextStep::CastVote` while any roster proposal still lacks a terminal
decision, nor while a durable intent exists for a proposal outside the roster,
except an intent whose vote the chain lifecycle owns or has finished: that
intent cannot be cleared, so it is neither reported nor allowed to withhold
casting, and helper planning tolerates it when comparing the durable roster
(`intent_is_lifecycle_owned`). Its vote is still advanced, its confirmed
vote's missing shares are still scheduled as `SubmitShares`, and a committed
but undispatched vote for such a proposal is retired by `CastVote` before the
bundle is cast again (regression tests
`an_unrostered_intent_the_chain_lifecycle_owns_does_not_withhold_casting`,
`an_unrostered_submitted_vote_is_still_advanced`,
`an_unrostered_confirmed_vote_still_schedules_its_missing_shares`,
`a_committed_vote_for_a_dropped_proposal_does_not_hold_its_bundle`,
`a_lifecycle_owned_intent_outside_the_roster_does_not_block_planning`).
Casting persists the vote before the immediate share is derived, so planning a
cast against a ballot that does not exactly match the roster would advertise a
step that can only fail after a ZKP #2 proof and a durable write. The remaining
proposals are reported through `RoundPlan::open_proposals` and the extra
intents through `RoundPlan::unrostered_intents`, which the host clears with
`VotingDb::clear_ballot_intent`; the bundle's `Delegate` prerequisite and the
advancement of votes already on the wire are unaffected.
Enforcement: `roster_is_terminal` in
[`resume_plan`](../zcash_voting/src/session.rs) and
`derive_immediate_share` in
[`share_tracking/delivery_plan.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/delivery_plan.rs).
Low-level pure planners remain implementation tools, not the wallet lifecycle
boundary.

The delivery and tracking entry points enforce the stronger trust-boundary
contract through validated fleet types: complete-plan preparation, prepared
batch submission, and `track_pending_shares` reject empty fleets, URLs that fail canonicalization,
and distinct spellings that canonicalize to the same helper identity with
`InvalidInput` before any storage or network effect. Misconfiguration must
surface as an error; configured entries are never silently dropped or
collapsed.

The SDK derives the target from the canonical fleet size. Crate-private raw
fan-out helpers retain explicit targets only for internal and regression use;
the public lifecycle admits only validated, SDK-derived planning state.

`target_count` is a target for definite acceptances, not an upper bound on the
number of helpers that may physically hold a share. An ambiguous helper may
have accepted the POST, while recovery must still obtain enough definite
acceptances. Recovery can therefore cause more than `target_count` helpers to
hold the same share.

### Helper selection and balancing

1. Production planning uses SDK-owned operating-system CSPRNG entropy. The
   host cannot inject, reuse, persist, or accidentally correlate timing and
   helper-order bytes. Helper order uses a Fisher-Yates shuffle with eight
   bytes per shuffle step.
2. Batch planning consumes independent timing entropy and helper-order entropy
   for every share. Reusing one sample or helper order for all shares is not
   allowed by the batch API.
3. Initial assignments prefer helpers with the lowest current assignment
   count. Random order breaks ties, balancing a complete `S`-share commitment
   across the planning pool without allowing an assignment count above
   `M = floor(3S / 4)`.
4. The minimum planning-pool size is `ceil(S * T / M)`. A readiness-ranked
   prefix can enlarge that pool, but too few ready helpers cannot shrink it.
   When necessary, planning includes configured fallback helpers after the
   ready prefix to provide the required assignment capacity.
5. For every complete normal commitment and every fleet with at least two
   helpers, each helper is initially assigned at most `M` shares. With the
   current `S = 16`, that is at most 12 of 16 shares, a strict maximum of 75
   percent under the three-quarters bound.
6. The derived `max_shares_per_server` is an initial-planning property, not a
   permanent privacy bound. Initial fallback and recovery can place additional
   shares on a helper when needed for liveness. The bound makes no claim about
   the combined view of colluding helpers.
7. Persisted plans remain positionally aligned with committed payloads. The
   high-level API accepts a domain share index and maps it to the committed
   payload position internally.
8. The commitment-wide bound applies only when all `S` shares are planned once
   in one batch. The SDK persists that complete batch atomically and reuses it
   after restart. Single-share mode, incomplete low-level batches, and legacy
   state marked `LegacyBestEffort` do not claim it.

## Scheduling invariants

### Initial `submit_at`

The last-moment window is two fifths of the interval from ceremony start to
vote end, rounded up to whole seconds and capped at six hours. Invalid or
zero-length timing has no last-moment window.

Outside that window, a delayed `submit_at` is sampled uniformly from:

```text
[now, min(last_moment_boundary, now + 100 hours))
```

The upper bound is exclusive. A delayed sample requires eight CSPRNG bytes.
The following conditions instead produce `submit_at = 0`:

- single-share mode;
- a missing or zero last-moment buffer;
- `now` at or after the last-moment boundary; or
- the round timing leaves no positive delay window.

The round-designated immediate share is independently forced to
`submit_at = 0`.

### Polling and overdue timing

For delayed shares, the recovery base time is `submit_at`. For immediate
shares, it is the durable `created_at`.

1. Status polling begins 10 seconds after the base time.
2. The overdue threshold is one quarter of the base-time-to-vote-end window,
   clamped to the range 30 seconds through one hour.
3. A confirmed share is never ready or overdue.
4. Overdue recovery is permitted only while more than 10 seconds remain before
   vote end. Equality closes the recovery window.
5. Without a vote-end time, status polling remains available, but a share
   cannot be classified as overdue.
6. Under-placement is independent of overdue status and can trigger early
   replenishment when no vote-end time is available.

After a tracking pass, two clocks compete and the next delay is whichever comes
first: a share already past its grace boundary is re-polled after 15 seconds,
and a share still before its boundary is waited for until it arrives, capped at
30 seconds. Taking the sooner of the two is what keeps a ready share from
queueing behind an unrelated share whose check is further out. Every nonempty
delay is at least three seconds. No unconfirmed shares yields no next delay.

### Driving passes to quiescence

`ShareTrackingDriver` repeats one pass until a round's shares are quiescent. It
adds no facts about a share: every decision about what a share needs stays in
the pass and the timing policy.

- **The cadence is the pass's, not the driver's.** Between two successful
  passes the driver waits exactly `next_delay_seconds`. It supplies a wait of
  its own only after a failed pass, which computed none.
- **No wait outlasts the round.** Whichever of the two produced it, a wait is
  shortened to the time left before vote end, less the time the pass that
  produced it consumed — the host clock is read before a pass, so a slow pass
  has already spent part of the window. The pass computes its delay from share
  rows, which say when a share is next worth polling and nothing about when the
  round closes; without the cap a run would sit on a round it can no longer act
  on for a whole poll interval, and a pass that failed near the boundary would
  spend the window's last usable retry waiting.
- **The host context is read once per pass.** A run can span hours, so a
  refreshed helper fleet or round timing reaches the next pass. A pass already
  running completes against the inputs it was given.
- **Vote end is checked before a pass, never after.** Recovery is closed past
  it, so a pass there could only re-poll shares it cannot act on.
- **Passes are strictly sequential, and a round admits one run.** Each pass
  plans from the rows the previous one wrote. The per-share locks keep two runs
  off one share but not off one round: interleaved runs re-poll shares the
  other has just answered, doubling the round's helper traffic for no added
  progress. A round is keyed by sidecar, wallet, and round id: two
  independently opened databases hold separate share rows, so they are not each
  other's concurrency.

  **A live holder turns a caller away; a departing one hands the round over.**
  The holder's own liveness is recorded with its claim — a holder is live while
  its control is uncancelled and still on the epoch it was admitted under — so
  a caller decides on state rather than by waiting. Meeting a live holder it
  stops at once with `AlreadyDriving`, without reading the host context or
  touching a share: the work it was started for is in flight, and a run can
  last until vote end, so queuing behind it would block the caller for hours.

  Meeting a *departing* holder it waits for the round to be released and takes
  over. That wait is **unbounded**: it ends when the holder releases the round
  or when the waiting caller is itself cancelled, which it observes every tick,
  and never by timing the holder out. A holder releases by completing or being
  dropped, so a host must poll a cancelled run's future to completion or drop
  it; one retained in neither state holds its round for the life of the process
  and leaves a replacement waiting. This is the case that matters most: a host that
  cancels a run and starts its replacement arrives between the cancel and the
  holder's return, and turning that replacement away would leave the round with
  no run at all until the next lifecycle event — possibly after vote end.
  Because the decision reads the holder's state rather than racing its unwind,
  a departing holder that is descheduled or slow still hands the round over.
  Admission is released when the holding run ends, however it ends, including a
  dropped future.

- **A run's subject is fixed at entry, and each pass acts under it.** The
  operation epoch is captured before the wallet, so a switch landing between
  the two cannot leave a run holding the old wallet's admission while accepting
  the new wallet's epoch as its own. The captured scope is then passed into
  every pass rather than re-captured there: a switch landing between a run's
  boundary check and its next pass would otherwise redirect that pass to
  another wallet's rows, under this run's admission and beside that wallet's
  own admitted run. The boundary check is what *stops* such a run; the passed
  scope is what keeps the pass already under way honest.
- **A failed pass's durable effects are kept.** A pass commits each
  confirmation and retained recovery attempt as it walks, so an error means the
  walk stopped, not that nothing happened, and the next pass walks only
  unconfirmed shares — an effect dropped here is one nothing can rediscover.
  The run folds those into its report and the `PassFailed` event carries them.
  This includes ambiguous outcomes retained inside one share's recovery walk
  before a later helper reservation fails; the nested recovery error carries
  those durable effects into the pass's partial report.
  An accumulated ambiguous attempt is withdrawn when a later pass retries that
  same helper and is told plainly: the run's `ambiguous` promises outcomes that
  remain unknown, and that one is known now. It does not return to `ambiguous`
  afterwards, because the share is known to have reached that helper however an
  even later attempt reads.

  A run accumulates *which* helpers a share reached, not how many times. A pass
  re-sends an overdue share to helpers that already accepted it — duplicate-safe,
  and the point of recovery — so the same `(share, helper)` recurs pass after
  pass, and a run bounded only by vote end has many. Each pair is recorded once;
  the per-pass `PassFinished` events keep every attempt for telemetry. `passes`
  counts dispatched passes rather than helper traffic for the same reason: a
  pass over a round that owes nothing, or one that fails validating the fleet,
  polls no helper at all.
  A partial pass's `unrecoverable` is *not* folded: that set is a statement
  about the whole round, and a prefix of the walk would narrow it. It is kept,
  not frozen — a share the partial pass confirmed or reached a helper with is
  no longer beyond repair, and is dropped from the retained set, so one report
  never calls a share both recovered and unrecoverable. A **cancelled** pass is
  partial for exactly the same reason and is folded the same way.
- **Cancellation is rechecked after the host callback.** `host_context()` is
  synchronous and arbitrary, and the vote-end and pass-budget checks read what
  it returned. Without the recheck a cancellation landing during the callback
  would be answered with a verdict about the round — `VoteEndReached` or
  `PassBudgetExhausted` — for a run the host had already dropped.
- **A run always reports why it stopped.** `ShareTrackingQuiescence` is
  exhaustive over the reasons, so a host acts on it rather than re-reading
  share rows: `NothingToTrack`, `AllConfirmed`, `VoteEndReached`, `Cancelled`,
  `AlreadyDriving`, `Failing`, and `PassBudgetExhausted`. `NothingToTrack` rests
  on the pass's own `unconfirmed_at_entry`, not on an empty effect list: a pass
  that confirmed and resubmitted nothing may still have walked a share another
  task confirmed underneath it, and that round did owe something. That
  observation is absent, not zero, when a pass failed before it could look —
  validating the fleet, or reading the round's shares — so a host is never told
  a round owed nothing on the strength of a pass that never asked.
- **A failing pass is retried, then surfaced.** `max_consecutive_failures`
  consecutive failures end the run with the messages, rather than retrying
  silently for the rest of the round. A successful pass resets the count.
  Cancellation outranks the failure verdict on both paths: a pass that failed
  because the host was draining the run reports `Cancelled`, with the failure
  still listed, rather than `Failing`.
- **Vote end bounds a healthy run; the pass budget is off by default.** A share
  that never becomes pollable, and a share nothing can still repair, both stay
  unconfirmed however long the run lasts, so both keep producing a next delay
  and keep looking pollable. That is the case a budget would bound — but a pass
  count is not a duration: passes are paced by the share rows, so a round of
  ready-but-unconfirmed shares produces one pass per
  `ready_poll_interval_seconds`, and a budget that looks generous expires hours
  into a window that can last days. A run stopped there would abandon
  confirmation and recovery with nothing to restart it, because the host starts
  runs on lifecycle events rather than on a timer. So `max_passes` is `None` by
  default and a run is bounded by vote end, confirmation, cancellation, and
  `max_consecutive_failures`. A host that sets a budget — for a round reported
  with no vote end, which has no time boundary at all, or for a test — gets
  `PassBudgetExhausted` naming the shares recovery could not repair, and the
  run never waits for a pass the budget will not allow.

  Stopping *as soon as* nothing can make progress needs a terminality
  classification the pass does not yet report: a share whose recovery material
  is beyond rebuilding may still be confirmed by a helper that already accepted
  it, so `unrecoverable` alone would end a run that could still finish. Until
  the pass reports that, an unsettleable share is polled for the rest of the
  round. That is wasted traffic, not lost correctness.
- **Cancellation is observed in three places** — between passes, during the
  wait, and inside a pass through its cancel callback — so a host draining a
  run does not wait out a delay. The wait is woken by the control rather than
  polled, because a wait spans the time until a share is actually due. An
  operation-epoch change is the same signal; the epoch is captured at entry, so
  a change made before a run is simply the epoch that run belongs to.

## Transport and timeout invariants

### Readiness

A helper is ready only when its base URL canonicalizes and `GET /status`
returns a 2xx `application/json` response whose `status` string equals `ok`
case-insensitively. Invalid URLs, transport failures, non-2xx responses,
oversized or invalid bodies, and any other status all produce `ready = false`.
Readiness is advisory and never fails the voting flow by itself.

`HelperClient::preflight_fleet` canonicalizes the caller's list, derives the
readiness target from the canonical fleet size, and starts every valid probe
concurrently. Its crate-internal raw preflight primitive receives that derived
target. It
collects responses through the two-second soft window. If the target is still
unmet, pending probes remain alive until enough helpers are ready, every probe
finishes, or the shared 30-second hard deadline expires. If the target is met
before the soft boundary, pending probes are stopped at that boundary; a zero
target still produces the ordered canonicalized result list but returns before
creating the probe task set, so it opens no connections even on a multi-threaded
runtime. Probes are not retried because readiness is only a bounded,
best-effort ranking hint; an unsuccessful helper remains available as a
planning fallback, and delivery applies its own retry and recovery policy.
Results preserve caller order, use canonical spellings for valid URLs, and
report invalid or unfinished entries as not ready.

### Default limits

| Operation or limit | Default | Enforced by |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Initial readiness window | 2 seconds (from `SHARE_HELPER_PREFLIGHT_SOFT_TIMEOUT_MILLISECONDS`) | `HelperClient::preflight_fleet` |
| Absolute readiness deadline | 30 seconds (from `SHARE_HELPER_PREFLIGHT_HARD_TIMEOUT_MILLISECONDS`) | `HelperClient::preflight_fleet` |
| One status GET | 5 seconds | `HelperClient::share_status` |
| Concurrent status GETs per share | 4 (from `SHARE_STATUS_MAX_CONCURRENT_POLLS`) | `poll_share_helpers` |
| Total status quorum search for one share | 10 seconds (from `SHARE_STATUS_POLL_BUDGET_MILLISECONDS`) | `poll_share_helpers` |
| One helper POST | 30 seconds | `HelperClient` |
| Active initial share workflows across the process | 32 | shared `vote/share_delivery` queue |
| Concurrent initial POSTs across the process | 128 (from `SHARE_HELPER_MAX_CONCURRENT_POSTS`) | `ConfirmedVote::submit_prepared_shares` |
| Total initial fan-out per share | 60 seconds | committed share delivery |
| Minimum budget to start an initial POST | 1 second | committed share delivery |
| Retry backoffs | 200 ms, then 600 ms | `HelperClient::with_retry` |
| Accepted response body | 256 KiB | `HelperClient` and `HyperTransport` |
| Ready-share poll interval | 15 seconds | `next_tracking_delay_seconds` |
| Recovery cutoff | 10 seconds before vote end | `track_pending_shares` |

The timeout passed to a `HelperTransport` covers connection setup, response
headers, and the complete response body. `HelperClient` wraps every transport
future in that deadline and rejects responses larger than 256 KiB, so these
limits also hold when a custom transport ignores the supplied timeout or
buffers an oversized response. `HyperTransport` additionally enforces both
while streaming. Its `with_http_connector` constructor lets a host supply
socket, proxy, DNS, or route-lifecycle behavior without reimplementing these
HTTP semantics; because Hyper pools connections, the supplied connector and
its returned I/O MUST also prevent an old pooled connection from surviving a
route change that forbids it. Successful responses MUST carry
`application/json` (optional
parameters such as `charset` are accepted); the client validates the content
type metadata returned by every transport. Non-2xx bodies are size-checked
before diagnostic string conversion while retaining their HTTP status for
retry and ambiguity classification.

Every caller-configurable helper timeout and retry delay must be nonzero and
representable by Tokio's monotonic clock. Configuration rejects values that
cannot form a deadline, and request, preflight, and retry paths use checked
instant arithmetic defensively rather than allowing caller-shaped durations to
panic the process.

A status GET remains eligible for its configured same-helper retries, but
`poll_share_helpers` wraps the complete quorum search for one share in a
ten-second outer budget and keeps at most four requests in flight. Budget
expiry can therefore stop an individual request or retry sequence before its
per-helper limits are exhausted. This budget applies separately to each share,
not to the complete tracking pass. An unconfirmed or stalled share returns when
its budget is exhausted so tracking can advance to later durable shares.

Initial fan-out has a shared 60-second budget. Before every attempt, including
same-helper retries, the client recomputes the remaining overall budget and
caps the complete transport timeout to the smaller of that budget and the
configured per-request timeout. No attempt starts with less than one second of
fan-out budget — such an attempt could only end outcome-unknown. A retry
backoff that would cross the fan-out deadline is skipped and the held error is
returned, so a definite failure is never converted into an unknown outcome by
cancellation during a sleep. If the deadline expires during an in-flight POST,
that attempt is ambiguous and is retained for polling.

### Endpoint retry policy

| Call | Attempts | Same-helper retry rule |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `GET /status` | 1 | Never retried |
| Initial `POST /shares` | Up to 3 | Retry only definite transient failures |
| `GET /share-status/{round_id}/{share_id}` | Up to 3 | Retry transient failures, including ambiguous transport failures |
| Recovery `POST /shares` | 1 | Never retried by the client |

The two configured backoffs produce at most three attempts. GET retries are
safe because the operation is idempotent. A POST MUST NOT be repeated against
the same helper after any ambiguous result. Once a dispatched POST completes,
its result takes precedence over cancellation: in particular, late cancellation
cannot turn an outcome-unknown result into `Cancelled`. Cancellation still
suppresses an otherwise-eligible retry or a request that has not started.

For current POST classification:

| Outcome | Classification | Same-helper retry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `queued` or `duplicate` | Definite acceptance | Stop |
| DNS, connect, TLS, or route failure before dispatch | Definite failure | Retry |
| HTTP 429 | Definite transient failure | Retry |
| HTTP 500, 502, 503, or 504 | Ambiguous transient failure | Never |
| Timeout | Ambiguous | Never |
| Failure after dispatch but before headers | Ambiguous | Never |
| Failure while reading the response body | Ambiguous | Never |
| 2xx with missing or unknown submission status | Ambiguous | Never |
| Other 5xx statuses | Ambiguous non-transient failure | Never |
| Other non-2xx statuses | Definite non-transient failure | Never |
| Body outside the closed `VoteShareWire` schema | Local definite failure | No request |

Caller-supplied bodies are parsed as the closed `VoteShareWire` schema,
validated, and canonically reserialized before submission. Invalid JSON,
unknown or duplicate fields, oversized bodies, noncanonical encodings, and
protocol-invalid values are rejected before the submission enters the scored
network path. Rejection therefore performs no request and does not increment
or clear the selected helper's health state.

Every 5xx response is ambiguous because the helper may have processed the
share before returning a server error. The narrower set `500`, `502`, `503`,
and `504` is also transient, which permits same-helper retries for idempotent
GETs. Initial POST submission never retries any ambiguous response, including
an otherwise transient 5xx.

## Initial fan-out invariants

`CommittedVote::prepare_share_delivery` is the planning boundary. It consumes a
`HelperFleetPreflight` and the authenticated complete proposal roster. In one
immediate SQLite transaction it requires an exact set of durable terminal
ballot intents, derives the round-wide immediate key from those intents and the
durable bundle set, uses SDK-owned entropy, plans every committed payload,
validates the fleet, target sets, immediate designation, and aggregate quota,
then writes one generation-bound `helper_share_plans` row. A repeat call,
including after restart, loads and returns the exact stored plan instead of
drawing a replacement, even when the newly preflighted helper fleet has
changed. The current preflight is used only when creating a plan; an existing
plan validates against its own persisted planning fleet. Existing round plans
are checked so roster drift cannot create a second or conflicting immediate
designation.

`ConfirmedVote::submit_prepared_shares` is the delivery boundary. It loads that
plan, requires the plan's exact current committed-vote generation, binds the
submitting handle to that generation, validates the immutable plan against its
persisted planning fleet, and separately validates the complete current fleet.
A handle must contain the exact current recovery snapshot, and
callers must recover a fresh handle after confirmation changes that snapshot.
It reconstructs and validates every payload before the first POST, then
executes all incomplete shares. The original target remains durable across
fleet churn. Planned targets still present in the current fleet are attempted
first, followed by every other current helper; removed helpers are never
contacted or counted. Target-count drift within the persisted plan, malformed
payloads, aggregate-quota violations, a nonzero schedule on the designated
immediate share, or a missing confirmed VC position fail before network I/O.
The raw per-share executor is
crate-private, and there is no public post-hoc delivery mutator.

The private `vote/share_delivery` package owns the shared initial-delivery
queue. Both singleton `ConfirmedVote` submission and completion of a confirmed
atomic unit use this implementation and the same admission semaphore. Unit
completion validates each member's complete plan before admitting any of its
shares, then queues share jobs in member order and persisted payload order.
Completed slots are refilled across proposal boundaries: the final slow share
of one proposal does not hold the next proposal's remaining work behind it.
Jobs retain one immutable validated plan per proposal and the wallet scope
captured before the queue's asynchronous work; the per-share executor still
revalidates the exact generation before durable preparation and dispatch.

A proposal-local plan or payload validation error prevents every POST for that
proposal while other valid proposals continue. A share execution error does
not abort sibling futures or stop independent proposals. Cancellation or an
operation-epoch change suppresses further admission and drains admitted
workflows under the existing transport cancellation rules below. Waiting for
share capacity does not consume the 60-second fan-out budget: that budget
still begins inside per-share fan-out, after its operation lock is acquired.
The lower-level POST-capacity wait remains inside that budget.

Reports finalize per proposal, including partial reports after share errors.
The primary share error is selected in persisted payload order, independently
of completion timing. Unprocessed and failed shares remain pending; completed
shares retain their durable acceptance or ambiguity. Existing public singleton
submission APIs and report shapes are unchanged.

Concurrent bundle execution uses this existing shared queue, rather than adding
per-bundle network budgets. The limits below remain process-wide across all
executors and wallets and are independent of CPU proving admission. Every
proposal's complete or partial report reaches the step ledger; completion events
may interleave across bundles while aggregate reports retain dispatch and
canonical proposal order. Full atomic chain confirmation still precedes every
fresh delivery. `a_finished_pipeline_refills_while_an_original_bundle_remains_blocked`
covers rolling bundle admission; the existing delivery queue conformance tests
continue to own sibling-progress and partial-report behavior.

Up to 32 share tasks across all wallets and committed votes in the process may
hold a delivery permit at once. Admission uses one process-wide budget of 128
units, charging each share `max(4, planned target_count)` units atomically. Thus
up to 32 shares with targets of four or fewer, or 12 shares with targets of ten,
can run at once; mixed fleets share the same budget. The charge uses the validated
persisted plan and is retained until outcomes are journaled, including across
fallback waves. Waiting for this budget occurs before share preparation and the
fan-out deadline, and cancellation releases the complete charge. This bounds the
aggregate planned fan-out of admitted queue workflows to 128 without changing
placement targets. Separately, a process-wide semaphore limits initial POST
operations to 128, including lower-level delivery calls outside this queue.
Waiting for a POST permit observes cancellation every 50 milliseconds and stops when one second or less
remains in the fan-out budget. An unsent reservation is cleared as a
definite failure on cancellation or budget exhaustion. After admission, the
executor re-reads the starting wallet's exact share nullifier and requires the
helper's attempting marker before dispatch. Deletion, generation replacement,
or loss of that reservation fails without sending the queued payload or
applying its outcome to a different generation. Each task retains
per-share serialization, the 30-second request deadline, the 60-second total
fan-out deadline, and durable
reservation-before-POST. `ShareBatchDeliveryReport` is sorted by domain share
index. It contains durable reports for completed tasks, the indexes still
queued when cancellation stopped new work, a final cancellation flag, and the
persisted placement guarantee. A completed task may still report a placement
deficit for tracking to repair. Cancellation never rolls back durable effects.

`LegacyBestEffort` is assigned only when v17 first creates a complete plan for
a vote that already has delivery rows from an older lifecycle. The SDK still
persists and reuses the new plan. The marker records that earlier placements
cannot be proven to satisfy the commitment-wide quota; it is never permission
to replan missing shares or to bypass aggregate-quota validation for the new
complete plan.

The `test-fixtures` feature exposes hidden `share::record`,
`share::record_delivery_fixture`, and `share::confirm_fixture` seed helpers for
external integration tests. They do not exist in production builds and MUST
NOT be used to model wallet submission behavior.

Complete-plan persistence and per-share preparation are both bound atomically
to the exact commitment-bundle generation validated for the `CommittedVote`
handle. Plan loading requires the handle's exact stored generation. The schema
trigger advances the persisted plan through the confirmation-only VC-position
transition, so a caller must recover a fresh `CommittedVote` before submitting.
A version-17 migration first normalizes released singleton recovery JSON that
predates nullable atomic-batch metadata. This happens before the plan table
exists, allowing confirmation to remain a byte-exact VC-position-only
transition without weakening generation comparison for any other recovery
change.
A replacement that lands after an earlier recovery read, including one that
preserves the vote commitment, invalidates the handle or plan and fails before
any helper POST instead of combining old payload or placement data with the
replacement generation.

After validation it creates or merges the durable share record. Persistence
returns the effective write-once `submit_at`; resumed fan-out rebuilds the wire
payload with that durable schedule before contacting any newly selected
helper. A recomputed plan therefore cannot split one share across different
schedules, and an existing immediate schedule (`submit_at = 0`) cannot be
resurrected as delayed.

Before network fan-out, live initial delivery and tracking passes for the same
share are serialized by the per-share operation lock described above. A
waiting operation re-reads the exact row generation after acquiring the lock.
Initial reservation itself is also target-aware: its atomic storage update
refuses a fresh configured helper when the number of configured definite
acceptances plus configured `attempting_urls` already reaches `target_count`.
An `AlreadyRecorded` result for one helper therefore cannot let an overlapping
pass walk disjoint fallbacks beyond the shared target.

Planned targets are attempted first, followed by the remaining configured
fleet. Health ranking is applied independently within those groups, so a
healthy fallback never moves ahead of a degraded planned target. For every
selected helper it writes `attempting_urls` before dispatch. Helpers are reserved
sequentially in waves capped at the outstanding definite acceptances, and each
wave's POSTs run concurrently subject to the process-wide 128-POST limit. The
executor:

1. re-evaluates helper health before each reservation;
2. selects each helper at most once in the outer fan-out (the client can still
   repeat a definite transient transport attempt under its retry policy);
3. resolves definite and ambiguous outcomes into their separate durable sets;
4. stops when `target_count` definite helpers have accepted, candidates are
   exhausted, cancellation fires, or the 60-second deadline expires; and
5. returns partial or empty acceptance as a report rather than treating it as
   a network-level function error.

Reaching placement capacity during reservation ends the current wave, not the
whole pass. The capacity-rejected helper remains eligible for the next wave.
After outcomes are persisted, definite failures and ambiguous completions can
free reservation capacity; accepted and still-attempting helpers continue to
count against the target. A wave that cannot reserve any helper ends the pass
without dispatch. `resumed_delivery_rechecks_capacity_after_wave_outcomes`
covers all three outcomes with a preexisting interrupted attempt.

Ambiguous attempts do not satisfy the target. The returned report summarizes
the exact current durable generation after fan-out, including placements made
by a serialized overlapping caller; a deleted or replaced generation fails
instead of returning its stale snapshot. The tracker is responsible for
repairing any remaining deficit. `ShareSubmissionReport` has no separate
in-flight field, so its `ambiguous_urls` projection includes both durable
`ambiguous_urls` and process-interrupted `attempting_urls`. Storage and tracker
logic continue to keep those states distinct.

### Delivery diagnostics

`share_tracking::delivery_progress` is the shared placement-evidence classifier
used by vote completion and observability. Completed tasks do not imply accepted
placement: after errors, cancellation, and unprocessed shares are accounted for,
a share with no accepted or ambiguous helper reports diagnostic failure; a share
with only ambiguous helpers reports pending. At least one definite acceptance
per share suffices for initial-delivery success, independently of redundancy and
confirmation. Diagnostics never change durable state or the returned domain
result.

The common committed-share delivery boundary binds the actual round, bundle,
proposal, and share identity to its local observation client before fallible
work. Concurrent shares and atomic-batch members retain their own identities
through HTTP retries without changing the parent step's identity.

Regression tests in `share_tracking/tests/observability.rs`:
`delivery_diagnostics_classify_evidence_and_boundary_precedence`,
`reported_delivery_preserves_results_and_classifies_completed_tasks`, and
`atomic_round_delivery_attributes_every_proposal_share_and_retry`.

Diagnostics additionally distinguish queue residence, active share execution,
POST-capacity and per-share lock waits, parsed acceptance, and durable acceptance.
Queue residence begins at enqueue, before admission; measuring it does not move
the fan-out deadline. Confirmation reports distinguish quorum observation,
generation-qualified persistence, and reuse of an existing confirmation.
Validated-fleet endpoint ordinals retain configured order through health sorting
and retries. Background driver waits are measured without changing cadence.
No diagnostic grants placement, confirmation, or permission to retry.

These boundaries are covered by
`queue_residence_precedes_admission_and_active_delivery_includes_journaling`,
`confirmation_diagnostics_distinguish_quorum_persistence_and_reuse`,
`status_endpoint_ordinals_survive_health_order_and_keep_pending_semantics`,
`cancelled_confirmation_reports_lock_wait_without_polling`, and
`reported_tracking_waits_preserve_cadence_and_cancellation`.
Reported helper POSTs also measure response headers/body collection, individual
future polls, suspension between polls, and first wake to the next poll. These
are nested diagnostic spans, not additional deadlines. The request-local
context preserves attribution across host route callbacks and exposes only a
closed phase vocabulary for route selection, direct/Tor requests and Tor body
collection. Disabled collection bypasses the polling wrapper. Diagnostics never
spawn request tasks or alter dispatch, timeout, placement or retry semantics.
`records_wake_delay_and_preserves_result_and_attribution`,
`disabled_observation_preserves_pending_and_cancellation`, and
`separates_response_headers_from_delayed_body` cover these boundaries.

See [the benchmark procedure](helper_delivery_benchmark.md) for correlation
limitations and the difference between helper acceptance and chain inclusion.

## Confirmation and health invariants

### Status interpretation

The status endpoint recognizes exactly `pending` and `confirmed`.

- Confirmation considers the wallet's complete current configured fleet,
  because the status is global rather than evidence of local share possession.
  Helpers are ordered by current health, at most four status requests are in
  flight, and completed slots are refilled while quorum remains possible.
- Fleets with at least two helpers require matching `confirmed` responses from
  two distinct helpers. Observing the second response stops scheduling, aborts
  outstanding status tasks, and persists confirmation before returning. Since
  polling is concurrent, the bounded in-flight group may already have been
  dispatched when quorum is observed.
- A one-helper fleet uses its only available confirmation. With two or more
  configured helpers, one confirmation remains insufficient: polling
  continues, the share remains durable-unconfirmed, and recovery is not
  suppressed.
- `track_pending_shares` and the focused `confirm_pending_share` are the only
  public confirmation mutation paths. Both use the same quorum poller and
  generation-bound write. The raw storage transition is crate-private so
  supported integrations cannot bypass the configured-fleet quorum.
- `pending` means only that the nullifier is not globally confirmed. It does
  not prove that the answering helper stores the share.
- A pending response from an ambiguous helper does not promote it into
  `sent_to_urls`.
- Invalid, missing, or unknown status values are failures. Polling continues
  through the remaining health-ordered candidates while time remains.
- The complete quorum search for one share ends after ten seconds. Budget
  expiry leaves that share durable-unconfirmed and advances the tracking pass
  to later shares; it is not a ten-second deadline for the complete pass.
- Only helpers in the wallet's current configuration are polled or counted
  toward placement.

and
[`share_tracking/tests/recovery.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/tests/recovery.rs).

### Helper health

Health is a process-local ordering hint, not a block list.

1. A usable scored status or submission response clears a helper's accumulated
   failures.
2. A non-cancellation error passed through `HelperClient::score` increments
   the consecutive-failure count. Readiness probes and failures rejected
   before scoring, such as an invalid helper base URL or malformed caller JSON,
   are not scored.
3. When the ten-second status budget expires, the tracker aborts and drains the
   task set, preserves every result that completed at the boundary, and records
   one failure only for each helper whose task actually aborted and therefore
   remains in flight. A completed poll keeps its own single success or failure
   score. Quorum and caller cancellation abort outstanding tasks without
   charging the abort itself as a helper failure.
4. Three consecutive failures demote a helper for 30 seconds.
5. Demotion moves the helper behind healthy peers but never removes it.
6. If every candidate is degraded, caller order is returned unchanged.
7. Cooldown expiry readmits a helper with two failures, so one subsequent
   failure immediately demotes it again.
8. Every accepted helper URL is canonicalized before health state is read or
   written. Equivalent scheme, host, default-port, mount-path escape, and
   trailing-slash spellings therefore share one score. Candidate ordering
   retains the caller's original spellings in its output; invalid URLs fall
   back to exact-string identity and remain unusable at the delivery boundary.
9. Health state is not persisted; restart gives all helpers a clean score.

`budget_expiry_preserves_boundary_quorum_without_penalizing_abort`. Local
submission validation is covered by `invalid_share_bodies_are_not_sent_or_scored`.

## Recovery invariants

For each unconfirmed share, `track_pending_shares` computes timing and current
definite placement from the intersection of durable state and the currently
configured helper set.

Resumed vote work (`AdvanceVote`, `AdvanceVoteBatch`, and the recovery
driver's equivalents) reconciles the chain before any helper-plan
preparation. The plan was made durable at cast time, or the vote predates
plans, and an open ballot must not keep an already-dispatched vote from being
polled or recovered; each vote's plan is loaded or created after confirmation,
right before its shares are delivered. A fresh `CastVote` still makes its
plans durable before the broadcast (regression test
`a_dispatched_vote_is_reconciled_before_its_ballot_is_terminal`).
`RoundPlan::immediate_share_key` reports the designation a persisted plan
carries whenever one exists (regression test
`the_plan_reports_the_persisted_immediate_share_after_its_proposal_leaves_the_roster`).

A share row with no accepted, ambiguous, or attempting helper (every initial
POST failed definitely, or a reservation was cleared before dispatch) is
`RoundPlan::blocking_share_work`. The planner still lists it as
`NextStep::ConfirmShare` but classifies it as `SubmitShares` recovery work,
and the executor runs that delivery from the durable plan instead of the
focused confirmation poll, which could never confirm a share no helper holds
(regression test
`a_blocking_confirm_share_step_delivers_before_polling`).

`RoundDriver` dispatches only that safely repeatable share work in the
foreground. A share with a definite acceptance or an ambiguous or attempting
helper is handed to background tracking, which owns confirmation,
duplicate-safe reconciliation, and replenishment. Such a step is filtered even
when the same plan contains a later deliverable share: polling it would return
`Pending`, promote it ahead of plan order again, and starve the delivery until
the round dispatch budget was exhausted
(`an_outcome_unknown_share_never_outranks_the_delivery_the_round_owes`).

### Replenishment and ordering

1. Under-placement starts replenishment immediately; it does not wait for the
   share to become status-checkable or overdue.
2. Early replenishment preserves the durable `submit_at`. It tries untried
   helpers first, then process-interrupted helpers. Explicitly ambiguous and
   accepted helpers remain excluded.
3. Overdue recovery rebuilds the payload with `submit_at = 0`. It tries
   untried helpers first, then interrupted helpers, explicitly ambiguous
   helpers, and finally previously accepted helpers. Already-journaled retries
   rely on their durable history instead of adding a fresh attempt marker.
4. The untried and previously accepted groups are independently randomized
   from SDK-owned operating-system CSPRNG bytes. Interrupted and ambiguous retry groups are
   deterministic last resorts whose membership is already persisted; health
   ordering is applied within every group.
5. An ambiguous helper stays poll-only for early replenishment. Overdue
   recovery re-POSTs it at most once per pass; a definite acceptance
   (including `duplicate`) moves it to `sent_to_urls`, while a definite
   failure of the re-POST leaves the outcome-unknown state untouched because
   it says nothing about the original POST.
6. An interrupted helper is retried at most once per pass. Acceptance makes it
   definite; an ambiguous or definite failure moves it to explicit ambiguity,
   consuming the early-retry crash marker without discarding uncertainty.
7. A definite failure is attempted at most once in one tracking pass. It can
   become eligible again in a later pass.
8. One pass continues until it fills the complete definite-placement deficit
   or has no eligible helper that accepts.
9. A configured interrupted marker is an independent reconciliation trigger,
   even when definite placement already meets the target and vote-end timing is
   unavailable. In that placement-satisfied case, tracking preserves the
   durable schedule and contacts only interrupted helpers; it does not expand
   to untried, explicitly ambiguous, or accepted helpers. It continues until
   every configured interrupted marker is classified or another normal stop
   condition fires.
10. Recovery may use any configured helper for liveness; initial balancing is
    not a recovery cap. Fresh reservations normally enforce the placement
    target. Overdue recovery and early recovery that must preserve
    untried-before-interrupted ordering select an explicit recovery policy that
    permits reservations beyond the target instead of changing the target
    value itself.

### Durability and cutoff

Before dispatching any initial or recovery POST, the helper MUST be durably
journaled: a fresh target is added to `attempting_urls`, while an overdue
re-POST to an ambiguous or accepted helper and any interrupted re-POST rely on
already-persisted delivery history. A definite acceptance moves the helper to
`sent_to_urls`; an ambiguous result moves a fresh helper to `ambiguous_urls`;
and a definite failure of a fresh attempt removes the reservation so the
helper can be retried in a later pass. A definite failure of an overdue
outcome-unknown re-POST leaves that earlier unknown state in place, while a
failure of an accepted fallback leaves the earlier acceptance intact. Recovery
persists each outcome transition before contacting another helper. Initial
delivery reserves every target in a wave durably before dispatch, waits for
all POST operations in that wave to finish, then persists their outcomes one
at a time in wave order before reserving or dispatching the next wave. Until
an outcome is persisted, its helper remains in `attempting_urls`, even if its
POST has already completed.

A process interruption during an in-flight initial or recovery request leaves
the helper in `attempting_urls`. On restart, that state is exposed as
outcome-unknown and receives a deliberate, duplicate-safe reconciliation after
untried helpers, even when vote-end timing is unavailable. A completed
non-acceptance promotes it to explicit ambiguity; a second early pass therefore
does not replay it again. A failed outcome write has the same conservative
behavior as process interruption.

Immediately before every recovery POST, the durable confirmation bit is
re-read. A fresh helper gets this check while its `attempting_urls` reservation
is written; an already-journaled outcome-unknown or accepted helper gets the
same check without changing its state. Confirmation by another task after the
tracking pass loaded its initial snapshot therefore suppresses every kind of
POST.

The vote-end cutoff is checked before recovery starts and again before every
POST using elapsed wall time. No new recovery POST starts at or after the
cutoff. Effects already completed and persisted are not rolled back.

Early replenishment also obeys the cutoff when vote-end time is known. Missing
vote-end time allows early replenishment with the original schedule but
suppresses overdue recovery.

### Recovery material

A recovery POST MUST use:

- the persisted commitment bundle;
- the requested proposal and share identity;
- the real confirmed vote-commitment tree position; and
- the preserved or immediate `submit_at` selected by the recovery mode.

Position zero is a valid tree position and MUST NOT be used as a placeholder
for a submitted but unconfirmed vote. Recovery with a commitment bundle but no
real position waits without posting. Missing or corrupt recovery material is
reported as unrecoverable rather than retried across helpers. If parseable
recovery material derives a different nullifier from the loaded share, tracking
re-reads the exact row generation: the same generation makes the mismatch
persistently unrecoverable, while a deleted or different generation is a
concurrent stale replacement and is silently left to its owning operation.

`recovery_nullifier_mismatch_from_replacement_remains_stale`, and
`resubmission_waits_for_the_confirmed_vc_position`.

### Cancellation

The cancellation callback is checked between shares, POST targets, attempts,
and retry backoffs. While concurrent status tasks are pending or an initial or
tracking pass is waiting for another operation on the same share, it is also
checked on a 50-millisecond interval. A prepared batch waiting for one of the
process-wide initial-delivery permits observes cancellation on the same
interval without waiting for a permit to be released. Cancellation prevents
additional requests from starting, returns the effects already recorded, sets
`ShareTrackingReport::cancelled` for tracking, and is not charged to helper
health when it suppresses pending work. Once the final observed request has
completed, its result takes precedence: cancellation observed afterward does
not replace that result or suppress its health score.

If cancellation becomes visible after a fresh helper has been reserved but
before its POST dispatches, recovery resolves that reservation as a definite
failure so the helper remains eligible on the next pass. Cancellation before a
retry backed by an interrupted, explicitly ambiguous, or accepted durable
state does not weaken or erase that existing evidence.

The concurrent status poller responds to caller cancellation or confirmation
quorum by signalling its status clients and aborting the task set. At budget
expiry it aborts first and drains the set, preserving results that completed at
the boundary before scoring only the tasks that actually aborted. This drops
in-flight status transport futures instead of waiting for their individual
request timeouts. Outside that poller, cancellation does not generally
interrupt an already-running custom transport request because `HelperTransport`
does not receive the callback. Initial fan-out's outer
60-second deadline can additionally drop the in-flight POST future; that
result is treated as ambiguous.

## Persistence and compatibility invariants

### Durable record semantics

1. The persisted key is wallet, round, bundle, proposal, and share index.
2. The share nullifier is derived from persisted recovery material rather than
   accepted from a wallet caller. The recovery material's embedded proposal
   MUST match the proposal in that persisted key. Re-recording the key with a
   different nullifier fails.
3. Re-recording merges accepted, ambiguous, and attempting history instead of
   replacing it.
4. A definite acceptance removes the same helper from the ambiguous set.
5. Accepted, ambiguous, and attempting sets are pairwise disjoint. Resolving an
   attempt removes it from `attempting_urls`.
6. Helper lists are canonicalized, deduplicated, and preserve first-occurrence
   order.
7. Re-recording cannot reduce `target_count`.
8. Re-recording preserves an existing confirmed bit, original `created_at`,
   and original `submit_at`. A repeated typed submission cannot replace the
   schedule already delivered to an accepted helper.
9. Immediate overdue recovery sets durable `submit_at` to zero. Early
   replenishment leaves it unchanged.
10. Share writes and confirmation MUST match the current durable decision for
   the proposal. Changing or skipping a recorded intent clears stale share
   rows. A delivery pass whose every eligible POST for some share ended
   ambiguously reports the step as pending rather than advanced: no helper
   definitely holds that share, the ambiguous helpers are excluded from the
   next initial pass, and only tracking can classify them, so rerunning
   delivery at once would make no progress
   (`a_share_every_helper_answered_ambiguously_waits_for_tracking_rather_than_advancing`).
11. Pending rounds are wallet-scoped and remain discoverable until every share
    is confirmed.
12. An asynchronous submission or tracking pass captures its wallet scope
    before storage or network work. Every post-await transition is conditional
    on that wallet and the exact persisted share nullifier. A deleted or
    replacement generation is left untouched, and its stale helper result is
    omitted from reports.
13. Storage operations that validate durable state before updating it begin an
    immediate SQLite transaction. The writer reservation is acquired before
    the validation read, so a concurrent WAL writer waits or is waited on
    within the configured busy timeout instead of invalidating the operation's
    snapshot with `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT`.
14. Confirmation and sent-server updates carry the nullifier of the share
    generation whose helper result they apply. The transactional read and
    update require that exact nullifier, so a delayed result for a cleared
    generation cannot confirm or add placement evidence to its replacement.

chain-generation preservation is covered by

change before vote recovery or helper-delivery rows can be cleared. A rejected
atomic batch retains the same protection because its authoritative member
roster still depends on those recovery rows; this is covered by
`rejected_vote_batch_never_reschedules_its_members`.

### Configuration and migration

The effective target is capped to both the protocol target cap `C = 10` and the
current valid configured fleet size. Persisted accepted or ambiguous helpers
removed from configuration are neither polled nor counted. A durable target
above `C` remains historical data but cannot drive additional placement above
the protocol cap. If a legacy row has `target_count = 0`, tracking derives
`min(ceil(N / 2), C)` from the current helper set.

During a pending vote, fleet contraction clamps the effective target and
replenishes among the remaining helpers where possible. Fleet expansion can
repair an unmet durable target but does not by itself increase a nonzero
target. Removed helpers may retain shares, so churn can increase the lifetime
set of helpers that possessed a share; liveness remains best-effort within the
reachable fleet and recovery cutoff.

Schema version 16 adds `ambiguous_urls` and `attempting_urls` with default `[]`
and `target_count` with default `0`. Databases from launch schema version 13
onward migrate in place; the migration MUST preserve existing round and
delivery rows. A schema newer than the crate supports is rejected.

Schema version 17 adds `helper_share_plans`. Its composite key and foreign key
match the owning vote, and deleting the vote cascades to its plan. The row
stores the exact `commitment_bundle_json` generation, canonical configured
fleet, complete plan vector, format version, placement guarantee, and creation
time. Any true recovery-generation replacement, clearing, or unrelated
recovery-material edit deletes the plan.

Confirmation is the sole snapshot transition that preserves a plan. On the
first `vc_tree_position: NULL -> non-NULL` vote update, the v17 trigger updates
a plan only when it is bound to the exact OLD JSON and replacing only the
JSON's `vc_tree_position` yields the exact NEW JSON. It then deletes any plan
whose snapshot still differs. Singleton and atomic-batch confirmation perform
this transition inside their existing transaction. Runtime loading requires
the plan and submitting handle to match that exact new snapshot. The
pre-confirmation handle becomes stale and must be recovered again. Every other
handle snapshot is also stale, including a same-commitment recovery
replacement.

The internal record keeps `attempting_urls` distinct. The compatibility wire
view has no separate attempting field, so it merges those helpers into
`ambiguous_urls`. Older hosts therefore retain the required poll-only behavior
without learning a new state or making an interrupted POST eligible again.

Persisted helper URLs from older code are canonicalized when read. Legacy
identities that no longer satisfy helper URL rules are never contacted,
polled, or counted, and never make a round unreadable — but they are recorded
delivery history, so every rewrite of a delivery list preserves them
verbatim rather than silently erasing them.

### Recovery cleanup

There is no standalone recovery-cleanup operation or
`clear_recovery_state` primitive. Ordinary cleanup and reset preserve helper
plans and delivery history required by unresolved or confirmed chain
submissions.

Explicit round and account deletion are destructive escape hatches. They delete
the owning rows, and foreign-key cascades remove the round's helper plans and
delivery history as part of that deletion. The records are not selectively
cleared while their round remains live.

`VotingDb::delete_round` refuses a round that shows broadcast evidence — a
delegation transaction hash, a VAN position, a chain submission, a vote, or a
delivered helper share — so ordinary deletion cannot destroy what recovers a
round. `VotingDb::delete_round_discarding_recovery` remains the explicit
per-round escape hatch for a deliberate abandonment and is not refused. Both
take the round's chain-submission gate before reading the evidence they act on,
and the checked path re-reads that evidence inside the transaction that
deletes, so a submission starting concurrently cannot lose its rows.

and the `rounds` foreign-key cascades.

Regression coverage must show that ordinary cleanup and reset preserve delivery
rows, explicit round or account deletion removes their owning rows, and no
standalone recovery-clear API or storage primitive remains.

## Helper identity and payload invariants

Configured helper bases:

- MUST use HTTP or HTTPS;
- MUST NOT contain credentials, a query, or a fragment;
- may contain a mount path or non-default port;
- have default ports and trailing slashes removed; and
- are canonicalized before identity, placement, and persistence comparisons.

Every endpoint appends `/shielded-vote/v1` after any configured mount path.
Round IDs accepted by the client are 64 hexadecimal characters or base64 that
decodes to exactly 32 bytes; the bytes must encode a canonical Pallas
base-field element. Share IDs in status paths are exactly 64 hexadecimal
characters. Both are normalized to lowercase hexadecimal.

Direct POST APIs require the closed `VoteShareWire` schema. They reject unknown
or duplicate fields, bodies larger than 4096 bytes, noncanonical encodings,
unsafe integer values, and invalid round identity, proposal, option, share,
tree-position, or `submit_at` fields, then canonically reserialize the body
before dispatch. Crate-generated payloads additionally validate their
relationship to persisted recovery material. One helper request contains only
the selected encrypted share, never the complete `all_enc_shares` collection.

[`share.rs`](../zcash_voting/src/share.rs).

## Host responsibilities and trust boundaries

The crate cannot enforce the following properties without cooperation from the
host wallet:

1. **Network route.** The host owns `HelperTransport`. A Tor or proxy transport
   MUST fail closed and MUST NOT fall back to a direct connection. A host can
   inject route-aware I/O into `HyperTransport::with_http_connector`, but it
   remains responsible for invalidating pooled connections when their route is
   no longer allowed.
2. **Transport contract.** A custom transport MUST preserve route policy,
   classify definitely pre-dispatch failures separately from ambiguous
   failures, and return response content-type metadata. The client enforces
   complete-request deadlines, the 256 KiB response limit, and JSON content
   type around every transport implementation.
3. **Entropy.** The SDK owns production entropy for complete-plan timing and
   helper ordering. Hosts do not supply randomness to the planning lifecycle.
4. **Share-tracking lifecycle.** Supported wallet integrations drive a round's
   helper shares with `ShareTrackingDriver::run`, which owns the cadence: it
   repeats a pass on the delay that pass computed, shortens every wait to what
   is left before vote end, and stops with a `ShareTrackingQuiescence` the host
   acts on. Once per pass, through `ShareTrackingHostSource`, the host supplies
   the complete current configured fleet, its clock, and the round's vote end;
   it also supplies cancellation and the operation epoch, through which app
   lock and a change of account or round reach the run. The host no longer owns
   the timer or the round-expiry boundary for share tracking, and cannot derive
   that schedule for itself — the values a host-side loop was assembled from
   are crate-private.

   A host may still run a single pass with `track_pending_shares`, and the pass
   reports its own `next_delay_seconds`, so a host scheduling by hand follows
   the schedule the SDK computed rather than one it derived. What it takes back
   is narrower than the whole vote-end boundary: the pass still enforces the
   recovery cutoff itself, refusing to resubmit within `resubmit_cutoff_seconds`
   of vote end. What it does not do is bound its own delay — that is computed
   from share rows alone — or stop polling once the round closes. So a host
   driving passes by hand owns not sleeping past vote end, and ending the loop
   there.
5. **Initial delivery invocation.** Supported wallet integrations bind a
   `RoundExecutor` to the complete proposal roster from the authenticated round
   configuration and drive it with `RoundDriver::run`, which supplies the
   complete current configured fleet, timing, and cancellation once per
   dispatch through `RoundHostSource`. Running the round's steps is the
   driver's: it carries the epoch it dispatched under into each step, which an
   integration selecting one step at a time could not do. An integration that
   needs per-obligation visibility reads it from `RoundDriveReporter` events
   rather than by driving steps itself. The executor obtains
   `HelperFleetPreflight`, prepares every affected delivery plan, advances the
   chain until confirmation is durable, recovers fresh `CommittedVote` handles,
   converts them to `ConfirmedVote`, and submits the prepared shares. Lower-level
   integrations may perform that exact sequence directly; submission is only
   offered on `ConfirmedVote`, which only the durable confirmation produces. The SDK
   validates the stored plan against its original planning fleet while limiting
   delivery to the current fleet. The host does not interpret recovery steps,
   select atomic-batch members, select the immediate share, serialize plans,
   select helpers, derive targets, expose share payloads, filter missing shares,
   or replan after restart.
6. **Helper-operator trust.** The protocol assumes that the authority supplying
   the wallet's helper configuration is trusted to choose independent operators
   and govern changes. URLs are endpoint identities, not authenticated operator
   identities, so helper counts are not Sybil-resistant. Configuration churn
   can expose shares to new operators, and shrinking to one helper lowers the
   confirmation requirement to one response. Pinned keys, authenticated
   per-round rosters, fixed minimum quorums, and key-rotation rules are outside
   the current protocol.
7. **Confirmation trust.** Helper responses are not chain proofs. The crate
   treats two matching responses from distinct currently configured helpers as
   the trusted quorum and persists confirmation internally. The host does not
   poll, corroborate, or confirm shares separately.
8. **Immediate-share lifecycle.** The host MUST wait until proposal choices
   are terminal before consuming the derived immediate-share designation.
   Incremental submission can otherwise observe a provisional designation.

### Exported policy values versus enforced behavior

`share_server_selection_policy` describes a two-second preflight soft window,
a 30-second hard deadline, and 128 concurrent POSTs.
`HelperClient::preflight_fleet` enforces both windows and derives the readiness
target internally. `ConfirmedVote::submit_prepared_shares` enforces the
process-wide 128-POST ceiling with a shared semaphore. Complete-plan persistence
lets the SDK validate commitment-wide quota, current-fleet compatibility, and
restart reuse before network dispatch. The POST ceiling is exercised by
`full_commitment_reaches_but_never_exceeds_128_posts`; cancellation and
budget expiry while queued are covered by
`post_capacity_cancellation_clears_unsent_reservations` and
`post_capacity_deadline_clears_unsent_reservations`. Generation-bound admission
is covered by `queued_delivery_rejects_a_deleted_round_before_posting`,
`queued_delivery_leaves_a_replacement_generation_untouched`,
`queued_delivery_requires_its_attempt_reservation`, and
`queued_delivery_does_not_validate_against_a_different_wallet`.
`helper_fanout_bounds_admitted_workflows` covers both the 32-share/four-target
boundary and the 12-share/ten-target boundary across two commitments.
`slow_successful_fanout_keeps_queued_shares_outside_the_deadline` delivers all
320 placements through 25-second successful POSTs without generating ambiguity.
`mixed_fleet_admission_cancellation_releases_the_full_charge` covers shared
admission across wallets with different targets, cancellation while capacity is
occupied, durable accepted outcomes, and resumption of unsent shares.
These are enforced behavior, not host integration metadata.

`SHARE_STATUS_MAX_CONCURRENT_POLLS` and
`SHARE_STATUS_POLL_BUDGET_MILLISECONDS` are enforced tracker behavior, not
descriptive metadata. `poll_share_helpers` limits each share to four in-flight
status requests and ten seconds of quorum search even when a configured
per-request timeout or retry sequence would run longer.

`HelperFleetPreflight`, complete-plan preparation, batch submission, and
tracking reject an empty fleet, invalid URLs, and distinct spellings of one
canonical identity with `InvalidInput` before storage or network effects.
Hosts remain responsible only for supplying the configured list from an
authenticated configuration source.

## Staging conformance coverage

The rules in this document are enforced by unit tests, which run against a clean
`drop` of the database and a scripted helper. Two of them are also exercised
against a live staging round by `recovery-conformance/`, which is where a claim
about *multi-helper* behaviour can first be made at all: driven against a single
configured helper the target count is 1, the per-helper quota is the whole
commitment, and the minimum planning pool is 1, so the placement rules in
[Initial fan-out invariants](#initial-fan-out-invariants) and
[Recovery invariants](#recovery-invariants) have nothing to decide.

`recovery-conformance/tests/helper_fleet_conformance.rs` drives a round through
ten configured helpers whose reachability changes between runs, and asserts:

- every helper a share was POSTed to was durably journaled first, not just some
  helper (the reservation rule at
  [Durable record semantics](#durable-record-semantics));
- a definite acceptance is never downgraded, including when the helper that
  gave it becomes unreachable;
- every share reaches its target number of definite acceptances, where the
  scenario leaves that target reachable;
- a resume fills only the deficit — no re-POST to a helper that already accepted
  while an untried helper remains, which is the ordering rule at
  [Replenishment and ordering](#replenishment-and-ordering);
- no share is POSTed to a helper outside the configured fleet.

`recovery-conformance/tests/stall_conformance.rs` covers
[Transport and timeout invariants](#transport-and-timeout-invariants) from the
outside: it makes one class of request never answer, below every deadline the
SDK applies, and asserts that the run ends by itself rather than wedging. The
helper POST, fan-out, readiness and status-poll budgets in
[Default limits](#default-limits) are each a target there.

Both are staging suites: they need the network, they kill processes, and they
are not part of `make test`. They do not replace the unit tests for these rules,
and a change to the rules must still update the unit tests this document cites.

## Reviewer checklist

A change to helper submission or recovery should answer all of the following:

- Does every share still apply the independent protocol target cap `C`?
- Does the strict three-quarters assignment limit remain derived from `S`, and is
  minimum planning-pool capacity still calculated from `S`, `T`, and `M`?
- Does every complete normal batch assign each helper no more than
  `floor(3S / 4)` shares, except for the documented one-helper case?
- Is the complete plan persisted before every POST and reused unchanged after
  restart?
- Is `LegacyBestEffort` confined to metadata for preexisting delivery rows?
- Does the change preserve independent CSPRNG timing and helper ordering?
- Can `single_share = true` reach planning with any payload count other than
  exactly one?
- Can an ambiguous POST be repeated against the same helper outside the
  deliberate, duplicate-safe overdue retry?
- Can an invalid configured helper URL disappear silently instead of failing
  the entry point?
- Is every initial and recovery helper reserved durably before dispatch?
- Can overlapping initial and tracking operations for one share independently
  advance beyond its placement target?
- Are accepted, ambiguous, and attempting states separated and disjoint?
- Is every recovery outcome resolved durably before another helper is
  contacted?
- Does early replenishment preserve `submit_at`, and does overdue recovery use
  zero?
- Is the vote-end cutoff checked before every recovery POST?
- Can a definite failure repeat more than once in one tracking pass?
- Can an unconfigured, invalid, or ambiguous helper be contacted?
- Are complete-request and total-delivery timeouts still bounded?
- Is status polling still bounded to four concurrent requests and ten seconds
  per share?
- Can a stalled share prevent later durable shares from being processed?
- Are quorum and caller-cancellation aborts unscored while status-budget expiry
  degrades each genuinely aborted request exactly once without re-scoring a
  boundary completion?
- Does cancellation avoid starting additional work without erasing completed
  effects?
- Can cancellation interrupt a wait for the per-share operation lock?
- Is the trust placed in a helper `confirmed` response still explicit?
- Do schema and wire changes preserve legacy rows and safe helper identity?
- Are readiness, status, per-share timeout, and the process-wide 128-POST limit
  still enforced by their SDK entry points?


## Combined delegation and cast integration

A combined delegation-and-cast envelope is one atomic vote unit, including
when it has one member. Fresh execution persists every signed vote and the
delegation authorization, then persists the complete helper plan before the
combined POST. A recovered unit already owned by the chain lifecycle reconciles
that lifecycle first. Helper delivery starts only after the unit's complete
confirmation records the final VAN and every VC position. The existing timeout,
placement, ambiguous-POST and durable delivery rules apply unchanged.

`combined_reconciliation_delivers_later_proposals_while_the_first_is_unfinished`
exercises combined reconciliation with full helper payloads: every helper POST
sees the confirmed delegation and both VC positions, and the later proposal
finishes while the first proposal's slow share remains in flight.

A definite first-POST rejection of the combined unit retires it: the members'
recovery JSON is cleared, which the existing generation-change triggers turn
into deleted helper plans and a cleared immediate-share designation, and the
members' share records are deleted with it. Nothing was delivered, because
delivery waits for confirmation. The recast is a fresh cast and re-plans its
helpers before its own POST.

Recasting is bounded. Consecutive rejections of one delegation generation are
counted durably, and at the cap the bundle stops being planned until a host
clears the streak, so a delegation the chain keeps refusing cannot re-plan and
re-deliver helper shares on every run. This changes only how often a recast is
planned; every share the recast does plan follows the timeout, placement,
ambiguous-POST and durable delivery rules unchanged.
`docs/round_orchestration_invariants.md` is the source of truth for the cap.

A route-shaped chain POST response — an HTML 200 fallback page or any 404/405,
including the gateway's exact JSON error shape — is not a definite rejection.
An intermediary can reproduce every unsigned shape after forwarding the POST,
so the response preserves the combined generation and its recovery material; a
later rejection cannot erase that dispatch ambiguity. This keeps helper
delivery recoverable if the envelope already reached the chain.
`replaced_post_response_keeps_combined_recovery_and_ballot_locked` and
`rejection_after_replaced_post_response_cannot_retire_combined_recovery` cover
that boundary. The chain-submission specification owns the response
classification and retry rules.

### Live combined recovery conformance

The `recovery-conformance` matrices exercise fresh combined rounds. Their scoped
snapshots require the complete authorization and ordered membership, helper plans
before a fresh POST, and the final VAN plus every contiguous vote position at
confirmation. Crash resumes preserve already-persisted PCZT/proof fingerprints,
authorization, and batch membership. A target-only round-driver pass removes the
voter mnemonic and supplies no signing inputs before normal round completion.

`recovery-conformance/tests/combined_recovery.rs` rejects missing authorization,
partial membership or confirmation, wrong generation metadata, missing helper
plans, and evidence belonging to another wallet. The combined POST fault wrapper
is exercised on both sides of dispatch by
`combined_post_stalls_on_the_selected_side_of_dispatch`. Live tree-read stalls
start from a real hashless dispatch because a fresh combined cast does not need
the initial tree synchronization of a standalone delegation.

The live `whole-fleet-down` case cancels its opening round drive through the
host control after the first `ShareOutcome` observation. It requires observed
refusals and unaccepted durable share work before restoring the fleet and
resuming. This bounds the intentionally unavailable phase without changing SDK
retry policy or treating a setup failure as evidence of helper recovery.

A normal conformance resume that stops only with `HelperDeliveryIncomplete`
reopens the same sidecar within the existing six-attempt bound. Background
tracking can confirm the attempted member while later members of its combined
unit still owe initial delivery; another round drive executes those obligations.
A mixed failure or exhausted bound remains a failure, and terminal checks still
require every member and all 144 shares.

The PIR stall fixture separates padded-note setup from proof-cache warmup. Its
armed fresh sidecar has stable fixture padding but no imported proofs, so it
must reach the real PIR transport fault. Fault-free resumes may import the
control's snapshot-bound proof cache; existing padding is never overwritten.
`cold_fault_keeps_dummy_nullifiers_but_resume_can_warm_proofs` and
`seeding_preserves_existing_padding_and_other_wallets_and_rounds` pin this
fixture behavior without changing the SDK's proof validation or retry rules.

If the foreground finishes but the last background tracking run reaches the
harness time budget, the parent reopens the same sidecar within its existing
six-attempt bound. This does not accept cancellation, mixed failures, or
unrecoverable shares as progress. The final comparison still requires all
144 shares confirmed; exhaustion remains a failure. The regression
`only_the_last_recoverable_background_budget_pause_is_resumed` pins this rule.

The conformance share-POST stall also stops through host cancellation after its
first completed share-delivery result. The injected request must be observed
and return through the SDK deadline before that callback can stop the drive.
Fault-free resume restores normal tracking and must confirm every share; the
host stop does not turn incomplete delivery into a successful round.

### Exact-key delivery revalidation

Initial delivery and the per-share tracking loop reload only the complete
wallet/round/bundle/proposal/share key, then check the expected nullifier.
Tracking additionally rejects a row already confirmed since its pass snapshot.
The tracker still loads its full pending set at pass boundaries. These reads
must not replace generation checks with cached state or weaken reservations.
`delivering_one_share_does_not_decode_unrelated_round_rows` guards against
reintroducing full-round decoding in a per-share operation;
`full_ballot_delivers_592_shares_with_bounded_admission` exercises a 37-proposal
ballot, durable acceptance and the 32-delivery limit. Existing queued-deletion,
wallet-scope, generation-replacement and confirmation-race tests remain binding.
