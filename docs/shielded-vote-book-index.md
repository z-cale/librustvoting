## Overview

| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `overview/design-principles.md` | Keystone compatibility, single-session voting, best-effort balance privacy (homomorphic encryption, vote splitting), unlinkable voting keys, auditable tallying, lightweight PIR-based nullifier proofs. |
| `overview/overall-flow.md` | The five phases: Phase 0 (setup with snapshot, proposals, EA key, VKs), Phase 1 (delegation via ZKP #1, VAN creation), Phase 2 (voting via ZKP #2 with VC and 16 encrypted shares), Phase 4 (share submission to servers), Phase 5 (share reveal via ZKP #3, homomorphic accumulation), then tally. |
| `overview/privacy-guarantees.md` | What is hidden (identity, total balance, individual amounts, which VC, real nullifiers) vs. revealed (aggregate totals, that you voted, share count). Trust model for EA and share submission servers. |
| `overview/comparison-to-today.md` | Compares to current Zcash governance: Keystone-compatible signing, no registration period (PIR), background ZKPs, vote amount privacy (splitting + unlinkable shares), auditable tally (Chaum–Pedersen proof). |

## User Flow

| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `userflow/wallet-setup.md` | User opens governance tab, wallet finds Orchard notes at snapshot height, generates voting hotkey, authorizes delegation (Keystone or in-app), submits ZKP #1. PIR nullifier exclusion, Merkle inclusion proofs, 0.125 ZEC minimum. |
| `userflow/casting-a-vote.md` | User selects proposals/choices, confirms once, wallet splits weight into 16 shares, encrypts with El Gamal, builds VC, runs ZKP #2, submits to chain, sends shares to server for ZKP #3 at staggered times. |
| `userflow/delegating-your-vote.md` | Delegation: VAN is spent and split into two VANs (delegate + delegator), same `allowed_proposals` bitmask. Supports partial delegation. Amounts stay private. |

## Data Types

| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `data-types.md` | Core data structures: **VAN** (Vote Authority Note — fields, commitment formula, nullifier, lifecycle), **VC** (Vote Commitment — shares_hash, proposal_id, decision), **Vote Share** (encryption, nullifier, constraints), **VCT** (Vote Commitment Tree — properties, insertion order, anchor heights). |

## Chain

| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `chain/role-of-the-vote-chain.md` | Vote chain as source of truth: VCT, three nullifier sets (governance, VAN, share), encrypted share accumulators. Verifies ZKP #1/#2/#3. |
| `chain/roles-and-admin.md` | Admin roles, permissions, and governance controls on the vote chain. |
| `chain/ea-key-setup-ceremony.md` | Per-round EA key ceremony: dealer chosen from block proposers, generates `ea_sk`/`ea_pk`, ECIES encryption for validators, ACK via PrepareProposal, fast/timeout confirmation, future TSS/DKG. |
| `chain/chain-api.md` | Chain API: voting session structure (`voting_round_id` from Poseidon), proposals (1–15 per session, 2–8 options), `vote_decision` encoding, tally results query. |
| `chain/building-from-source.md` | Build instructions for the vote chain binary. |
| `chain/setting-up-a-validator.md` | Validator setup, key registration, joining the network. |
| `chain/setting-up-a-monitoring-node.md` | Monitoring node setup (non-validating). |

## ZKP Specifications

| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `zkps/zkp1-delegation-proof.md` | **ZKP #1 — Delegation:** Proves ownership of up to 5 unspent Orchard notes at snapshot height and correct delegation to a governance hotkey. Public inputs: nullifiers, roots, VAN, `vote_round_id`. Conditions: signed note, output note, VAN integrity, ballot scaling, per-note checks. |
| `zkps/zkp2-vote-proof.md` | **ZKP #2 — Vote Proof:** Proves valid vote by consuming a VAN and producing a new VAN (decremented proposal authority) and a VC with 16 encrypted shares. VAN ownership, nullifier, shares sum, range checks, El Gamal integrity, VC integrity. |
| `zkps/zkp3-vote-reveal-proof.md` | **ZKP #3 — Vote Reveal:** Proves a single encrypted share comes from a valid VC without revealing which one. Submission server runs this. VC membership, share opening (blinded commitments), share nullifier derivation. |

## Delegation

| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `delegation/delegation-setup.md` | Delegation mechanics: delegator's VAN is spent, two new VANs created (delegate + delegator). ZKP ensures amount sum and `allowed_proposals` preservation. |
| `delegation/partial-delegation.md` | Partial delegation: VAN split so delegate gets `delegated_amount`, delegator keeps the rest. Supports multiple delegates via successive delegations. |
| `delegation/server-delegated-shares.md` | Why share submission is delegated to servers: reliability, temporal unlinkability (staggered submissions), parallelism. Payload format, server behavior, trust model. |

## Appendices

| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `appendices/el-gamal.md` | El Gamal on Pallas: encryption `(r*G, v*G + r*R)`, additive homomorphism for tally, decryption via bounded discrete log. Ballot scaling reduces bit-width. |
| `appendices/tally.md` | Tally flow: (1) public ciphertext aggregation per `(proposal_id, decision)`, (2) EA decryption with `ea_sk` + bounded discrete log, (3) Chaum–Pedersen proof of correct decryption. |
| `appendices/PIR-Efficient Merkle Path Retrieval.md` | PIR spec for private Merkle path retrieval over ~50M leaves using YPIR (SimplePIR). Three-tier layout (11 plaintext + 8 PIR + 7 PIR layers), sentinel nullifiers, row layouts, storage/bandwidth analysis. |
