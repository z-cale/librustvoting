# Vote Throughput Benchmark

This directory contains the canonical vote throughput stress test:
- `tests/voter_throughput.rs`

If a user asks about vote throughput stress testing, vote submission load, or helper share-processing throughput, point them to `e2e-tests/tests/voter_throughput.rs` first.

## Fixture regeneration

The throughput benchmark depends on the large reusable fixture set under `e2e-tests/fixtures/10k/`.

If the voting circuits change in a way that affects delegation fixtures or cast-vote inputs, you must:
1. Regenerate the fixture set locally.
2. Replace the local `10k` fixture files.
3. Upload the updated files to the DigitalOcean Spaces bucket path used by fixture download fallback: `https://vote.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/10k/`

The expected files are:
- `manifest.json`
- `delegations.json`
- `cast_vote_inputs.json`

Example regeneration command:

```bash
FIXTURE_COUNT=10000 FIXTURE_DIR=e2e-tests/fixtures/10k \
  cargo test --release --manifest-path e2e-tests/Cargo.toml \
  --test generate_fixtures -- --ignored --nocapture
```

## Running the benchmark

### 1. Initialize a benchmark-friendly chain

```bash
mise run chain:init-benchmark
```

This calls `sdk/scripts/init_benchmark.sh`, which overrides the default helper
settings before invoking `init.sh`. The values are baked into
`~/.svoted/config/app.toml` under the `[helper]` section:

| Setting | Default (dev) | Benchmark override | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| `mean_delay` | 60 | **0** | Unlinkability delay mean (seconds). 0 = process immediately. |
| `min_delay` | 90 | **0** | Minimum delay floor (seconds). 0 = no floor. |
| `process_interval` | 5 | **1** | How often the processor checks for ready shares (seconds). |
| `max_concurrent_proofs` | 2 | **16** | Parallel ZKP #3 proof generators. |
| `expose_queue_status` | false | **true** | Enables `GET /api/v1/queue-status` (used by the test to monitor progress). |
| `api_token` | *(empty)* | **benchmark-helper-token** | Must match `HELPER_API_TOKEN` passed to the test. |

The fixtures use `vote_end_time = 2099-12-31` so they never expire. With
production delay settings, shares would be spread over decades — the zero-delay
overrides are essential.

### 2. Start the chain (separate terminal)

```bash
mise run chain:start
```

### 3. Run the throughput test

```bash
HELPER_API_TOKEN=benchmark-helper-token \
VOTER_FIXTURE_DIR=e2e-tests/fixtures/10k \
cargo test --release --manifest-path e2e-tests/Cargo.toml \
  --test voter_throughput -- --ignored --nocapture
```

### Useful overrides

- `STRESS_VOTER_COUNT=50` — use only the first N voters from fixtures (quick smoke test)
- `PROOF_GEN_THREADS=4` — control runtime ZKP #2 generation parallelism
- `WAVE_SIZE=10` and `WAVE_INTERVAL_MS=1000` — control helper share arrival pattern
- `SHARE_STALL_TIMEOUT_SECS=1800` — fail if share processing makes no progress for N seconds (0 = disabled)

## Results

The test writes its report to:
- `artifacts/voter-throughput/metrics.json`
- `artifacts/voter-throughput/summary.md`

The benchmark currently covers:
- delegation submission
- cast-vote proof generation and submission
- helper share enqueue
- helper ZKP #3 generation and reveal-share submission

It does not include tally/finalization.
