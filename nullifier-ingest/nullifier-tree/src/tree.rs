/// Depth of the nullifier range Merkle tree.
///
/// Each on-chain nullifier produces approximately one gap range (n nullifiers
/// → n + 1 ranges). Zcash mainnet currently has under 64M Orchard nullifiers.
/// We plan for this circuit to support up to 256M nullifiers, so the tree
/// needs capacity for ~2^28 leaves: `log2(256 << 20) + 1 = 29`.
pub const TREE_DEPTH: usize = 29;

/// A gap range `[low, high]` representing an inclusive interval between two
/// adjacent on-chain nullifiers. Each leaf in the Merkle tree commits to one
/// range via `hash(low, high)`.
///
/// **Exclusion proof**: to prove a value `x` is not a nullifier, the prover
/// reveals a range `[low, high]` where `low <= x <= high` plus a Merkle path
/// proving that range is committed in the tree.
///
/// Every on-chain nullifier `n` acts as a boundary between two adjacent ranges:
/// the range before it has `high = n - 1` and the range after has `low = n + 1`.
/// Because the bounds are `n ± 1`, the nullifier `n` itself falls outside every
/// range — so `low <= x <= high` can only succeed for non-nullifier values.
///
/// Example with sorted nullifiers `[n1, n2]`:
/// ```text
///   Range 0: [0,    n1-1]   ← gap before n1
///   Range 1: [n1+1, n2-1]   ← gap between n1 and n2
///   Range 2: [n2+1, MAX ]   ← gap after n2
/// ```
/// `n1` is the boundary of ranges 0 and 1; `n2` is the boundary of ranges 1
/// and 2. Neither `n1` nor `n2` is contained in any range.
///
/// ## Tree structure and padding
///
/// The tree has a fixed depth of [`TREE_DEPTH`]. With `n` on-chain nullifiers
/// the tree contains `n + 1` populated leaves. The remaining `2^TREE_DEPTH -
/// (n + 1)` leaf slots are empty.
///
/// Empty slots are filled with `poseidon_hash(0, 0)` — the commitment of an
/// empty (low=0, high=0) leaf. At each level of the tree, the empty hash is
/// computed by self-hashing the level below:
/// `empty[0] = poseidon_hash(0, 0)`, `empty[i+1] = hash(empty[i], empty[i])`. Any
/// subtree consisting entirely of empty leaves collapses to the empty hash for
/// that level. Odd-length layers are padded with the empty hash before hashing
/// up to the next level.
///
/// This means the root is deterministic for a given set of nullifiers
/// regardless of the tree capacity — adding more empty slots doesn't change
/// the root because they all reduce to the same empty subtree hashes.
