# Gadgets

## Address ownership gadget

Shared circuit gadget that encapsulates **address ownership** and **SpendAuthG fixed-base multiplication** used by both ZKP #1 (delegation) and ZKP #2 (vote proof). Same pattern as the shared VAN integrity gadget (`van_integrity.rs`): chip-agnostic, takes config/chip refs and assigned cells.

### Why it exists

Both delegation and vote proof circuits enforce:

1. **SpendAuthG fixed-base mul** — `[scalar] * SpendAuthG` (delegation: `alpha` then add `ak_P` for `rk`; vote proof: `vsk` then `ExtractP` for `ak`).
2. **Address ownership** — `ivk = CommitIvk(ak, nk, rivk)`, then `pk_d = [ivk] * g_d`, constrained to the claimed address.

This module provides a single place for that constraint logic so delegation and vote proof don’t duplicate the same CommitIvk → scalar mul → constrain wiring.

### API

### `spend_auth_g_mul(ecc_chip, layouter, label, scalar) -> Result<Point, Error>`

Computes `[scalar] * SpendAuthG` using `OrchardFixedBasesFull::SpendAuthG`.

- **Delegation (condition 4):** `alpha` → `alpha_commitment`; caller adds `ak_P` and constrains to `rk` (public inputs).
- **Vote proof (condition 3):** `vsk` → `vsk_ak_point`; caller does `ak = vsk_ak_point.extract_p().inner().clone()` then passes `ak` into `prove_address_ownership`.

### `prove_address_ownership(..., ak, nk, rivk, g_d, pk_d_claimed) -> Result<AssignedCell<Base, Base>, Error>`

1. Calls `commit_ivk(..., ak, nk, rivk)` to get `ivk`.
2. Converts `ivk` to `ScalarVar`, computes `derived_pk_d = g_d.mul(ivk_scalar)`.
3. Constrains `derived_pk_d == pk_d_claimed`.

Returns the **ivk cell** so callers (e.g. delegation) can reuse it for per-note diversified address checks (e.g. condition 11).

- **Delegation (condition 5):** `ak` from `ExtractP(ak_P)`, `nk` from keystone note, `g_d_signed`, `pk_d_signed`. Returned `ivk_cell` is passed into per-note slot synthesis.
- **Vote proof (condition 3):** `ak` from `ExtractP([vsk]*SpendAuthG)`, `vsk_nk`, `rivk_v`, `vpk_g_d_point`, `vpk_pk_d_point`. Return value is unused.

### Dependencies

- Reuses existing **CommitIvk** from `commit_ivk.rs` (same `CommitIvkChip`, `SinsemillaChip`, `EccChip`). No new chips; this is a thin wrapper: CommitIvk + scalar mul + constrain_equal.

### Usage

- **Delegation:** `orchard/src/delegation/circuit.rs` — condition 4 uses `spend_auth_g_mul`, condition 5 uses `prove_address_ownership`.
- **Vote proof:** `orchard/src/vote_proof/circuit.rs` — condition 3 uses both.

The main Orchard action circuit could later call `spend_auth_g_mul` and `prove_address_ownership` for consistency (optional follow-up).

## VAN integrity gadget

Shared circuit gadget that encapsulates the **VAN (Vote Authority Note) integrity** two-layer Poseidon hash used by ZKP #1 (delegation, condition 7) and ZKP #2 (vote proof, conditions 2 and 6). Same pattern as the address ownership gadget: chip-agnostic, takes config and assigned cells.

### Why it exists

Both delegation and vote proof circuits need a shared commitment shape for the governance commitment / Vote Authority Note:

- **Delegation (condition 7):** when creating the output note, the circuit commits to `gov_comm` = two-layer hash(domain_van, g_d, pk_d, value, round, proposal_authority; rand). This becomes the VAN that can later be spent in vote proof.
- **Vote proof (condition 2):** the voter proves the old VAN commitment is correctly formed (same hash structure) so that VANs created by delegation are valid leaves.
- **Vote proof (condition 6):** the new VAN commitment (after decrementing proposal authority) uses the same hash structure.

A single module provides the two-layer Poseidon (core hash then blind with rand) so both circuits use identical constraints and hashes.

### API

**`DOMAIN_VAN`** — `u64` constant `0`. Domain tag for Vote Authority Notes; `DOMAIN_VC = 1` for Vote Commitments. Prepended as the first Poseidon input for domain separation in the shared vote commitment tree.

**`van_integrity_hash(g_d_x, pk_d_x, value, voting_round_id, proposal_authority, gov_comm_rand) -> pallas::Base`**

Out-of-circuit two-layer hash. Computes:

- `gov_comm_core = Poseidon(DOMAIN_VAN, g_d_x, pk_d_x, value, voting_round_id, proposal_authority)`
- `result = Poseidon(gov_comm_core, gov_comm_rand)`

Used by builders and tests to compute the expected VAN / gov_comm value.

**`van_integrity_poseidon(poseidon_config, layouter, label, domain_van, g_d_x, pk_d_x, value, voting_round_id, proposal_authority, gov_comm_rand) -> Result<AssignedCell<Base, Base>, Error>`**

In-circuit two-layer hash with the same structure. Takes assigned cells and a `PoseidonConfig` (P128Pow5T3, width 3, rate 2). Returns the final hash cell. Callers constrain it to their witnessed commitment (delegation: gov_comm; vote proof: vote_authority_note_old or vote_authority_note_new).

### Dependencies

- Uses **Poseidon** only: `halo2_gadgets::poseidon::Pow5Chip`, `P128Pow5T3`, `ConstantLength<6>` and `ConstantLength<2>`. No ECC or Sinsemilla; any circuit that already has a compatible Poseidon config can call `van_integrity_poseidon`.

### Usage

- **Delegation:** `orchard/src/delegation/circuit.rs` — condition 7 assigns `domain_van` from `DOMAIN_VAN`, then calls `van_integrity_poseidon` and constrains the result to `gov_comm` (public input).
- **Vote proof:** `orchard/src/vote_proof/circuit.rs` — condition 2 (old VAN) and condition 6 (new VAN) call `van_integrity_poseidon` and constrain to `vote_authority_note_old` and `vote_authority_note_new` respectively.
