# zally

Cosmos SDK application chain for private voting using Zcash-derived cryptography.

## Technical Assumptions

1. The chain launches with a single genesis validator. Additional validators join post-genesis via `MsgCreateValidator`. Validator set changes beyond that are handled via major upgrades or a PoA module (future).
2. Client interaction avoids Cosmos SDK protobuf encoding:
   - **Tx submission:** Client sends a plain JSON POST; server handler parses JSON and encodes as needed.
   - **Query:** gRPC gateway supports JSON out-of-the-box.
3. No native `x/gov` module. The vote module implements custom private voting instead of reusing standard Cosmos governance.

## Architecture

### Module: `x/vote`

The vote module has two major subsystems: the **EA Key Ceremony** (one-time chain setup) and **Voting Rounds** (created after the ceremony completes).

### EA Key Ceremony

The Election Authority (EA) key ceremony is a **one-time chain-level setup**, not per voting round. Once the ceremony completes and `ea_pk` is confirmed in global state, any number of voting sessions can reference that key. The ceremony must complete before any `MsgCreateVotingSession` is accepted.

The ceremony lifecycle is tracked by a singleton `CeremonyState` in the KV store, separate from `VoteRound`.

#### State Machine

The ceremony is a looping state machine. Timeout in any active phase resets to `INITIALIZING`, allowing the ceremony to restart cleanly.

```
        ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
        │                                      │
        v                                      │
  INITIALIZING ──> REGISTERING ──> DEALT ──> CONFIRMED
                       │              │
                       │   timeout    │  timeout
                       └──────────────┘
                              │
                              v
                        INITIALIZING
```

| From | To | Trigger | Condition |
|------|-----|---------|-----------|
| INITIALIZING / nil | REGISTERING | First `MsgRegisterPallasKey` | Auto-created on first registration |
| REGISTERING | DEALT | `MsgDealExecutiveAuthorityKey` | >= 1 validator registered, valid ea_pk, 1:1 payload-to-validator mapping |
| REGISTERING | INITIALIZING | EndBlocker timeout | `block_time >= phase_start + phase_timeout` (full reset) |
| DEALT | CONFIRMED | `MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey` | **All** registered validators have acked |
| DEALT | INITIALIZING | EndBlocker timeout | `block_time >= phase_start + phase_timeout` (full reset, regardless of partial acks) |

Key behaviors:
- **CONFIRMED** is only reached when every registered validator explicitly acks. Timeout never produces CONFIRMED.
- Timeout in either REGISTERING or DEALT performs a **full reset** to INITIALIZING (all fields cleared).
- After CONFIRMED, no reset mechanism exists.

#### Messages

**`MsgRegisterPallasKey`** -- A validator registers their Pallas public key for the ceremony.
- Creates the ceremony (REGISTERING) on first call, or from INITIALIZING after a reset
- Sets `phase_start` and `phase_timeout` (120s default) when transitioning to REGISTERING
- Validates the key is a valid, non-identity, on-curve Pallas point (32 bytes compressed)
- Rejects duplicate registrations from the same validator address
- Only accepted while ceremony is REGISTERING or INITIALIZING

**`MsgDealExecutiveAuthorityKey`** -- The bootstrap dealer distributes encrypted `ea_sk` shares.
- Validates `ea_pk` is a valid Pallas point
- Requires exactly one ECIES-encrypted payload per registered validator (1:1 mapping)
- Validates each payload's `ephemeral_pk` is a valid Pallas point
- Stores `ea_pk`, payloads, dealer address, updates `phase_start` and `phase_timeout` (30s default)
- Transitions ceremony to DEALT

**`MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey`** -- A registered validator acknowledges receipt of their `ea_sk` share.
- **Auto-injected via PrepareProposal** — validators do not submit this manually
- Cannot be submitted through the mempool (blocked by `ValidateAckSubmitter` during CheckTx)
- Only accepted while ceremony is DEALT
- Rejects acks from non-registered validators
- Rejects duplicate acks from the same validator
- Records the ack with block height and signature `SHA256("ack" || ea_pk || validator_address)`
- When all validators have acked, transitions to CONFIRMED
- With round-robin proposer selection and `n` validators, all acks complete within ~`n` blocks after the DealerTx lands

#### Auto-Ack via PrepareProposal

When a block proposer detects the ceremony is in DEALT state and they haven't acked yet, `PrepareProposal` automatically:
1. Loads the validator's Pallas secret key from `vote.pallas_sk_path`
2. ECIES-decrypts their `ea_sk` share using `pallas_sk`
3. Verifies `ea_sk * G == ea_pk` (rejects garbage from a malicious dealer)
4. Injects `MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey` into the proposed block
5. Writes `ea_sk` to `vote.ea_sk_path` on disk, priming the auto-tally system

`ProcessProposal` validates injected ack txs on non-proposer validators: checks that the creator is a registered validator, the ceremony is DEALT, and no duplicate ack exists.

**Configuration** (`app.toml`):
```toml
[vote]
ea_sk_path = "$HOME/.zallyd/ea.sk"
pallas_sk_path = "$HOME/.zallyd/pallas.sk"
```

**CLI**: `zallyd pallas-keygen --home $HOME/.zallyd` generates the Pallas keypair (mirrors `ea-keygen`). Called automatically by `init.sh`.

#### Timeout (EndBlocker)

Both REGISTERING and DEALT phases are subject to timeout (`block_time >= phase_start + phase_timeout`):
- On timeout in either phase, the ceremony is **fully reset** to INITIALIZING (all fields cleared)
- Registration timeout: 120 seconds (validators to register)
- Deal/ack timeout: 30 seconds (validators to acknowledge)

#### ECIES Encryption Scheme

Each validator's `ea_sk` share is encrypted using ECIES over the Pallas curve with **SpendAuthG** as the generator (the same generator used for ElGamal encryption in the ZKP circuit and for Pallas keypair generation):

1. Ephemeral scalar `e` is generated randomly
2. `E = e * SpendAuthG` (ephemeral public key, stored on-chain)
3. `S = e * pk_i` (ECDH shared secret, where `pk_i = sk_i * SpendAuthG`)
4. `k = SHA256(E_compressed || S.x)` (symmetric key derivation; `S.x` is the x-coordinate with sign bit cleared)
5. `ct = ChaCha20-Poly1305(k, nonce=0, ea_sk)` (authenticated encryption)

Validators decrypt by computing `S = sk_i * E` and deriving the same symmetric key. The zero nonce is safe because each ephemeral key `e` is fresh, making the derived key `k` unique per encryption.

**Why SpendAuthG?** The Pallas keypair (`pallas-keygen`) is generated using `elgamal.KeyGen`, which uses SpendAuthG as the generator. The ECIES ephemeral key must use the same generator so that the ECDH shared secrets match: `e * (sk * SpendAuthG) == sk * (e * SpendAuthG)`. Using the standard Pallas generator would break this equality.

### Voting Rounds

After the ceremony reaches CONFIRMED, voting sessions can be created.

```
ACTIVE ──> TALLYING ──> FINALIZED
  ^
  │ (gated: requires CONFIRMED ceremony)
```

**`MsgCreateVotingSession`** reads `ea_pk` from the confirmed ceremony state (not from the message). The round stores its own copy of `ea_pk` for future key rotation support.

**`MsgSubmitTally`** is auto-injected via `PrepareProposal` when a round enters TALLYING (same pattern as auto-ack). Cannot be submitted through the mempool.

### PrepareProposal / ProcessProposal Pipeline

`PrepareProposal` composes two injectors that run sequentially on each proposed block:
1. **Ceremony ack injection** — if ceremony is DEALT and the proposer hasn't acked, inject `MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey`
2. **Tally injection** — if a round is TALLYING, decrypt accumulators and inject `MsgSubmitTally`

`ProcessProposal` validates all injected txs on non-proposer validators before accepting a block. Both `MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey` and `MsgSubmitTally` are blocked from the mempool (CheckTx rejects them).

### Custom Wire Format

Vote and ceremony transactions bypass the standard Cosmos SDK `Tx` envelope. Each transaction is a single-byte tag followed by a protobuf-encoded message body:

```
[tag (1 byte)] [proto-encoded message body]
```

| Tag | Message | Category |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `0x01` | `MsgCreateVotingSession` | Voting round |
| `0x02` | `MsgDelegateVote` | Voting round |
| `0x03` | `MsgCastVote` | Voting round |
| `0x04` | `MsgRevealShare` | Voting round |
| `0x05` | `MsgSubmitTally` | Voting round (injected) |
| `0x06` | `MsgRegisterPallasKey` | Ceremony |
| `0x07` | `MsgDealExecutiveAuthorityKey` | Ceremony |
| `0x08` | `MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey` | Ceremony (injected) |

Any transaction whose first byte does not match a known tag is decoded as a standard Cosmos SDK `Tx` (e.g. `MsgCreateValidator`).

### REST API

The chain exposes a JSON REST API alongside CometBFT RPC. Clients POST JSON bodies for transaction submission and GET for queries — no protobuf encoding required on the client side.
