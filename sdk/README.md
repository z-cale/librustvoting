# zally

Cosmos SDK application chain for private voting using Zcash-derived cryptography.

## Technical Assumptions

1. The chain launches with a single genesis validator. Additional validators join post-genesis via `MsgCreateValidatorWithPallasKey`, which atomically creates the validator and registers their Pallas key for the ceremony. Raw `MsgCreateValidator` is blocked in the ante handler for live transactions. Validator set changes beyond that are handled via major upgrades or a PoA module (future).
2. Client interaction avoids Cosmos SDK protobuf encoding:
   - **Tx submission:** Client sends a plain JSON POST; server handler parses JSON and encodes as needed.
   - **Query:** gRPC gateway supports JSON out-of-the-box.
3. No native `x/gov` module. The vote module implements custom private voting instead of reusing standard Cosmos governance.

## Architecture

### Module: `x/vote`

The vote module has two major subsystems: the **EA Key Ceremony** (one-time chain setup) and **Voting Rounds** (created after the ceremony completes).

### EA Key Ceremony (Per-Round)

The EA key ceremony runs **automatically per voting round**. Each `MsgCreateVotingSession` creates a round in `PENDING` status and snapshots all eligible validators (bonded + registered Pallas key) into the round's ceremony fields. The ceremony proceeds automatically via `PrepareProposal` — no manual intervention is needed after initial Pallas key registration.

#### Per-Round Ceremony State Machine

Ceremony state is stored on the `VoteRound` itself (fields `ceremony_status`, `ceremony_validators`, etc.). There is no global singleton ceremony state.

```
  PENDING (REGISTERING) ──> PENDING (DEALT) ──> ACTIVE (CONFIRMED)
                                  │
                       timeout    │
                       (< 1/3)   │
                          │       │
                          v       v
                    REGISTERING   ACTIVE (CONFIRMED)
                    (reset for    + strip non-ackers
                     re-deal)     (≥ 1/3 acked)
```

| From | To | Trigger | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| REGISTERING | DEALT | Auto-deal via PrepareProposal | Block proposer is a ceremony validator |
| DEALT | CONFIRMED + ACTIVE | MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey | >= 1/3 validators acked (fast path) |
| DEALT | CONFIRMED + ACTIVE | EndBlocker timeout | >= 1/3 acked at timeout; non-ackers stripped |
| DEALT | REGISTERING | EndBlocker timeout | < 1/3 acked; reset for re-deal by next proposer |

Key behaviors:
- **1/3 threshold** — only 1/3 of snapshotted validators need to ack for the ceremony to confirm (uses integer arithmetic: `acks * 3 >= validators`).
- **Auto-deal** — the block proposer automatically deals when it detects a PENDING round in REGISTERING state. No manual `ceremony.sh deal` step.
- **Auto-ack** — each block proposer auto-acks via PrepareProposal when it detects a DEALT round.
- **Miss tracking** — validators snapshotted into a ceremony who fail to ack have a consecutive miss counter incremented. After 3 consecutive misses, the validator is jailed.
- **Ceremony log** — each state transition appends a timestamped entry to `ceremony_log` on the round, visible in queries and the admin UI.

#### Pallas Key Registration (One-Time)

Validators register their Pallas key once via `MsgRegisterPallasKey` or `MsgCreateValidatorWithPallasKey`. Keys are stored in a global registry (prefix `0x0C`) and persist across rounds.

#### Auto-Deal and Auto-Ack via PrepareProposal

`PrepareProposal` composes two ceremony injectors:
1. **Auto-deal** — if a PENDING round is in REGISTERING state and the proposer is a ceremony validator, generate `ea_sk`/`ea_pk`, ECIES-encrypt shares for all ceremony validators, and inject `MsgDealExecutiveAuthorityKey`.
2. **Auto-ack** — if a PENDING round is in DEALT state and the proposer hasn't acked, decrypt the share, verify `ea_sk * G == ea_pk`, inject `MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey`, and write `ea_sk` to disk.

#### Timeout (EndBlocker)

Only the DEALT phase has a timeout (default: 30 minutes). On timeout:
- **>= 1/3 acked:** Confirm ceremony, strip non-ackers, activate round. Increment miss counter for each non-acker; jail if >= 3 consecutive misses.
- **< 1/3 acked:** Reset to REGISTERING for re-deal by the next proposer. Increment miss counters.

#### ECIES Encryption Scheme

Each validator's `ea_sk` share is encrypted using ECIES over the Pallas curve with **SpendAuthG** as the generator:

1. `E = e * SpendAuthG` (ephemeral public key)
2. `S = e * pk_i` (ECDH shared secret)
3. `k = SHA256(E_compressed || S.x)` (symmetric key)
4. `ct = ChaCha20-Poly1305(k, nonce=0, ea_sk)` (authenticated encryption)

### VoteManager Role

The VoteManager is a singleton on-chain address that gates who can create voting sessions. Before any `MsgCreateVotingSession` is accepted, a VoteManager must be set.

**`MsgSetVoteManager`** -- Sets or changes the VoteManager address.
- **Bootstrap:** When no VoteManager exists, any bonded validator can set the first one
- **Update:** Once set, the current VoteManager **or any bonded validator** can change it
- Non-validators who are not the current VoteManager are rejected
- Uses custom wire format tag `0x0C` and REST endpoint `POST /zally/v1/set-vote-manager`
- Stored as a singleton `VoteManagerState` in the KV store (key `0x0A`)

### Voting Rounds

After the ceremony reaches CONFIRMED and a VoteManager is set, voting sessions can be created.

```
ACTIVE ──> TALLYING ──> FINALIZED
  ^
  │ (gated: requires CONFIRMED ceremony + VoteManager)
```

**`MsgCreateVotingSession`** reads `ea_pk` from the confirmed ceremony state (not from the message). The round stores its own copy of `ea_pk` for future key rotation support. Only the VoteManager can create voting sessions. An optional `description` field provides human-readable context for the round.

**`MsgSubmitTally`** is auto-injected via `PrepareProposal` when a round enters TALLYING (same pattern as auto-ack). Cannot be submitted through the mempool.

### PrepareProposal / ProcessProposal Pipeline

`PrepareProposal` composes two injectors that run sequentially on each proposed block:
1. **Ceremony ack injection** — if ceremony is DEALT and the proposer hasn't acked, inject `MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey`
2. **Tally injection** — if a round is TALLYING, decrypt accumulators and inject `MsgSubmitTally`

`ProcessProposal` validates all injected txs on non-proposer validators before accepting a block. Both `MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey` and `MsgSubmitTally` are blocked from the mempool (CheckTx rejects them).

### Custom Wire Format

Vote and ceremony transactions bypass the standard Cosmos SDK `Tx` envelope. Each transaction is a single-byte tag followed by a protobuf-encoded message body:

```
[tag (1 byte)] [proto-encoded message body]
```

| Tag    | Message                            | Category                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `0x01` | `MsgCreateVotingSession`           | Voting round            |
| `0x02` | `MsgDelegateVote`                  | Voting round            |
| `0x03` | `MsgCastVote`                      | Voting round            |
| `0x04` | `MsgRevealShare`                   | Voting round            |
| `0x05` | `MsgSubmitTally`                   | Voting round (injected) |
| `0x06` | `MsgRegisterPallasKey`             | Ceremony                |
| `0x07` | `MsgDealExecutiveAuthorityKey`     | Ceremony                |
| `0x08` | `MsgAckExecutiveAuthorityKey`      | Ceremony (injected)     |
| `0x09` | `MsgCreateValidatorWithPallasKey`  | Ceremony                |
| `0x0B` | `MsgReInitializeElectionAuthority` | Ceremony                |
| `0x0C` | `MsgSetVoteManager`                | Management              |

Any transaction whose first byte does not match a known tag is decoded as a standard Cosmos SDK `Tx`. Tag `0x0A` is deliberately skipped because it collides with the standard Cosmos Tx protobuf encoding (field 1, wire type 2). Note that raw `MsgCreateValidator` is blocked by the ante handler for live transactions -- post-genesis validators must use `MsgCreateValidatorWithPallasKey` (tag `0x09`) instead.

### REST API

The chain exposes a JSON REST API alongside CometBFT RPC. Clients POST JSON bodies for transaction submission and GET for queries — no protobuf encoding required on the client side.
