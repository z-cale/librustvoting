//! Building and driving one benchmark round, in the child process.
//!
//! This is the sibling of `recovery-conformance/src/round_run.rs`, and the two
//! deliberately stay separate rather than sharing one parameterised driver.
//! That file is the *control* three live fault matrices compare against;
//! threading a benchmark's needs through it would change the thing those
//! matrices are measured by. What this drops from it: the crash seams, the
//! stall route, `RunMode`, and the fixed three-proposal ballot. What it adds:
//! reported entry points, so every phase of the run is timed.
//!
//! Every drive runs in a child process, as it does there, and for the same
//! reason: the provers run on dedicated OS threads that are not cancellable and
//! hold the round lock through a cloned `Arc`, so a drive that ends early can
//! leave a thread still writing to the sidecar. In a child that dies with the
//! process; in the parent it would corrupt the state the metrics are read from.
