//! Multi-proposal staging benchmark for `zcash_voting`.
//!
//! One command provisions a round on the staging vote chain with a ballot the
//! caller chooses, drives one clean vote to completion, and reports where the
//! time went — per phase, per proposal, and with the concurrency each phase
//! actually reached.
//!
//! # Why it exists
//!
//! `docs/helper_delivery_benchmark.md` describes a capture procedure: run a
//! wallet against staging, save the observability snapshots from three
//! boundaries, then compute occupancy and percentiles by hand. That procedure
//! produced the numbers in the 32-slot admission work, and it is not repeatable
//! at any useful cost — so no phase below helper delivery has ever been
//! measured beside it, and a regression in proving, PIR, or chain advance would
//! be invisible until someone repeated the whole thing manually.
//!
//! This crate is that procedure as a command. It measures; it asserts almost
//! nothing.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! Not a conformance suite. It injects no crash, no stall, and no helper
//! outage — `recovery-conformance` owns all three, and this crate borrows its
//! staging plumbing rather than duplicating it. A benchmark's only correctness
//! claim is that the round it timed actually completed, because a run that
//! delivered nothing quickly is not a fast run.
//!
//! Deliberately outside the workspace default members: it needs the network and
//! it provisions real rounds, so it must never run as part of `make test`.
