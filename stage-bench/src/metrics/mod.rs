//! Turning one run's observability snapshots into the numbers that name a
//! bottleneck.
//!
//! A run produces several snapshots — the round drive, then each background
//! tracking invocation — and each is measured against its own monotonic origin
//! with a wall-clock anchor. Every record here is placed on one absolute
//! timeline by adding its snapshot's `started_at_unix_us` to its
//! `started_after_us`, which is what lets a phase table say when helper
//! delivery ended and confirmation began rather than reporting two unrelated
//! totals.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not done
//!
//! Parent and child stage durations are never summed. A queue wait is already
//! inside the delivery time that contains it, and adding them would inflate
//! every helper phase by the wait that precedes it. Each stage is reported on
//! its own row, and the reader composes them.
//!
//! # When the numbers cannot be trusted
//!
//! A snapshot that dropped records, summary updates, or stage starts describes
//! less than the run did. Concurrency and percentiles derived from it are
//! floors, not measurements, so [`Metrics::complete`] is false and every
//! consumer says so rather than quietly reporting a smaller peak.
