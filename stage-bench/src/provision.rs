//! Getting a round on the staging chain to benchmark against.
//!
//! A round is one-shot: a delegation is consumed per round and cannot be
//! replayed, so every run needs its own. Creation also serialises chain-wide —
//! the chain refuses a second `CreateVotingSession` while one ceremony is
//! pending — so two benchmark runs must never provision concurrently.
